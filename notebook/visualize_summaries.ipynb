      " we used convection enhanced delivery (ced) to characterize gene delivery mediated by adeno associated virus type (aav1) by tracking expression of hrgfp (humanized green fluorescent protein from renilla reniformis) into the striatum, basal forebrain, and corona radiata of monkey brain. four cynomolgus monkeys received single infusions into corona radiata, putamen, and caudate. the other group (n = 4) received infusions into basal forebrain. thirty days after infusion animals were killed and their brains were processed for immunohistochemical evaluation. volumetric analysis of gfp positive brain areas was performed. aav1 hrgfp infusions resulted in approximately 550, 700, and mm3 coverage after infusion into corona radiata, striatum, and basal forebrain, respectively. aside from targeted regions, other brain structures also showed gfp signal (internal and external globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus), supporting the idea that aav1 is actively trafficked to regions distal from the infusion site. in addition to neuronal transduction, a significant nonneuronal cell population was transduced by aav1 vector, for example, oligodendrocytes in corona radiata and astrocytes in the striatum. we observed a strong humoral and cell mediated response against aav1 hrgfp in transduced monkeys irrespective of the anatomic location of the infusion, as evidenced by induction of circulating anti aav1 and anti hrgfp antibodies, as well as infiltration of cd4+ lymphocytes and upregulation of mhc ii in regions infused with vector. we conclude that transduction of antigen presenting cells within the cns is a likely cause of this response and that caution is warranted when foreign transgenes are used as reporters in gene therapy studies with vectors with broader tropism than aav2.\n",

      " over the past two decades, the bulk of gastrointestinal (gi) endoscopic procedures has shifted away from diagnostic and therapeutic interventions for symptomatic disease toward cancer prevention in asymptomatic patients. this shift has resulted largely from a decrease in the incidence of peptic ulcer disease in the era of antisecretory medications coupled with emerging evidence for the efficacy of endoscopic detection and eradication of dysplasia, a histopathological biomarker widely accepted as a precursor to cancer. this shift has been accompanied by a drive toward minimally invasive, in situ optical diagnostic technologies that help assess the mucosa for cellular changes that relate to dysplasia. two competing but complementary approaches have been pursued. the first approach is based on broad view targeting of areas of interest or red flags. these broad view technologies include standard white light endoscopy (wle), high definition endoscopy (hd), and electronic chromoendoscopy (narrow band type imaging). the second approach is based on multiple small area or point source (meso/micro) measurements, which can be either machine (spectroscopy) or human interpreted (endomicroscopy, magnification endoscopy), much as histopatholgy slides are. in this paper we present our experience with the development and testing of a set of familiar but smarter standard tissue sampling tools that can be routinely employed during screening/surveillance endoscopy. these tools have been designed to incorporate fiberoptic probes that can mediate spectroscopy or endomicroscopy. we demonstrate the value of such tools by assessing their preliminary performance from several ongoing clinical studies. our results have shown promise for a new generation of integrated optical tools for a variety of screening/surveillance applications during gi endoscopy. integrated devices should prove invaluable for dysplasia surveillance strategies that currently result in large numbers of benign biopsies, which are of little clinical consequence, including screening for colorectal polyps and surveillance of flat dysplasia such as barretts esophagus and chronic colitis due to inflammatory bowel diseases.\n",

      " the present study examined the morphological development of the otolith vestibular receptors in quail. here we describe epithelial growth, hair cell density, stereocilia polarization, and afferent nerve innervation during development. the otolith maculae epithelial areas increased exponentially throughout embryonic development reaching asymptotic values near post hatch day p7. increases in hair cell density were dependent upon macular location; striolar hair cells developed first followed by hair cells in extrastriola regions. stereocilia polarization was initiated early, with defining reversal zones forming at e8. less than half of all immature hair cells observed had non polarized internal kinocilia with the remaining exhibiting planar polarity. immunohistochemistry and neural tracing techniques were employed to examine the shape and location of the striolar regions. initial innervation of the maculae was by small fibers with terminal growth cones at e6, followed by collateral branches with apparent bouton terminals at e8. calyceal terminal formation began at e10, however no mature calyces were observed until e12, when all fibers appeared to be dimorphs. calyx afferents innervating only type i hair cells did not develop until e14. finally, the topographic organization of afferent macular innervation in the adult quail utricle was quantified. calyx and dimorph afferents were primarily confined to the striolar regions, while bouton fibers were located in the extrastriola and type ii band. calyx fibers were the least complex, followed by dimorph units. bouton fibers had large innervation fields, with arborous branches and many terminal boutons.\n",

      " maternal aggression is highly expressed during lactation and serves to protect the developing young from intruders that may injure the offspring. one neurochemical modulator of maternal aggression appears to be arginine vasopressin (avp). earlier research supports a role for avp in maternal aggression in rats as treatment with an avp antagonist in lactating, primiparous rats stimulates the mothers aggression towards intruders the second half of lactation, but that avp itself was without major effects during early lactation. recent behavioral findings indicate that during a second lactation (multiparous) mothers display higher levels of maternal aggression than do first time mothers (primiparous). the present study was designed to assess the involvement of avp as mothers acquire reproductive experience. therefore, the involvement of avp in maternal aggression in multiparous mothers was measured after intracerebroventricular (icv) treatment with both avp and a v1a receptor antagonist. behavior was assessed during early lactation when aggression levels are very high in multiparous mothers as well as during late lactation when aggression levels are lower. the results demonstrated that icv infusions of avp significantly reduced maternal aggression in multiparous females on day of lactation, whereas v1a antagonist infusions increased aggression on day of lactation. these findings suggest that the role of avp in maternal aggression may be amplified as reproductive/lactational experiences increase, and support the involvement of the central avp system as a key modulator of maternal protection of the young.\n",
