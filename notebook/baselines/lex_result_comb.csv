0,"context: evidence suggests that babies' fat mass at birth is greater if their mothers were themselves fatter during pregnancy, but it is unclear whether this association persists into childhood. objective: to examine the relation between maternal size in pregnancy, early growth and body composition in children. design: prospective cohort study setting: southampton, uk. participants: nine year old children whose mothers had participated in a study of nutrition during pregnancy. main outcome measures: fat mass and lean mass measured by dual energy x ray absorptiometry, adjusted for height (fat mass index and lean mass index). results: fat mass index at age nine years was greater in children whose mothers had a larger mid upper arm circumference in late pregnancy or a higher pre pregnant body mass index. for one standard deviation (sd) increase in maternal mid upper arm circumference in late pregnancy, fat mass index rose by 0.26 (95% ci 0.06 0.46) sd in boys and by 0.44 (95% ci 0.31 0.57) sd in girls. for one sd increase in maternal pre pregnant bmi, fat mass index rose by 0.26 (95% ci 0.04 0.48) sd in boys and by 0.42 (95% ci 0.29 0.56) sd in girls. conclusions: mothers with a higher pre pregnant body mass index or a larger mid upper arm circumference during pregnancy tend to have children with greater adiposity at age nine. the extent to which this is attributable to genetic factors, the influence of maternal lifestyle on that of her child, or maternal adiposity acting specifically during pregnancy on the child's fat mass cannot be determined in this study.","Few studies have examined the long term consequences of maternal overnutrition on fat mass in the offspring. Although many studies have shown associations between high birthweight and greater BMI in later life, birthweight provides only a crude indicator of prenatal experience and BMI depends on both fat and lean tissue mass so may provide a misleading indicator of adiposity. New research, however, suggests that children's adiposity may be influenced by their mother's own fatness during pregnancy.These guidelines recommend that women with a normal pre pregnant BMI (19.8 26.0 kg/m2) should gain 12.5 18 kg, that women with a BMI of <19.8 kg/m2 should gain 12.5 18kg, that women with a BMI of 26.0 29.0 kg/m2 should gain 7 11kg and that women with a BMI >29.0 kg/m2 should gain at least 6.0kg. In 1991 2 Caucasian women aged 16 years with singleton pregnancies of <17 weeks' gestation were recruited at the Princess Anne Maternity Hospital in Southampton, UK; diabetics and those who had undergone hormonal treatment to conceive were excluded. We measured their height in early pregnancy using a stadiometer.To avoid problems with collinearity, we performed multivariate linear regression analyses of these variables separately . This exclusion had little effect . In total, 15 children had a birthweight of <2.5kg.","Few studies have examined the long term consequences of maternal overnutrition on fat mass in the offspring.

1,"summary information on the development and functions of rostral prefrontal cortex (pfc), or brodmann area 10, has been gathered from different fields, from anatomical development to functional neuroimaging in adults, and put in relation to three particular cognitive and behavioural disorders. rostral pfc is larger and has a lower cell density in humans than in other primates. it also has a large number of dendritic spines per cells and numerous connections to the supramodal cortex. these characteristics suggest that rostral pfc is likely to support processes of integration or coordination of inputs particularly developed in humans. the development of rostral pfc is prolonged, with decreases in grey matter and synaptic density continuing into adolescence. functions attributed to rostral pfc, such as prospective memory, appear to similarly follow a prolonged development until adulthood. neuroimaging studies have generally found reduced recruitment of rostral pfc, e.g. in tasks requiring response inhibition, in adults compared with children or adolescents, which is consistent with grey matter maturation. the examples of autism, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder and schizophrenia show that rostral pfc could be affected in several disorders due to the susceptibility of its prolonged maturation to developmental abnormalities.","In humans, this region continues developing throughout childhood and adolescence. Therefore, the recent data that have been obtained on the function of rostral PFC tend to come from human lesion studies and functional imaging. Second, experimental psychology and neuroimaging studies that shed light on rostral PFC development will be reviewed.(p. 103) There have been very few studies investigating mentalising ability after age 6. A century ago Brodmann suggested that a homology between the human and monkey frontal cortical regions was very unclear.Moreover, the study by Shaw and colleagues suggests that processes of cortical extension and pruning might play an important role in the variations of intellectual abilities between individuals. Indeed, one can find recruitment of the rostral PFC in just about any kind of task (see ). These regions receive auditory or polymodal input from the superior temporal sulcal region (, ).","In humans, this region continues developing throughout childhood and adolescence.

2,"the present study examined ethnic, gender and age differences in perceived discrimination, and the association between perceived discrimination and psychological well being in a nationally representative sample of black adolescents. data are from the national survey of african life (nsal), which includes african american and caribbean black youth. results indicate that the majority of black youth perceived at least one discriminatory incident in the previous year. adolescents at later stages of development perceived more discrimination than those at earlier stages, and african american and caribbean black males perceived more discrimination than their female counterparts. perceptions of discrimination were positively linked to depressive symptoms and negatively linked to self esteem and life satisfaction, regardless of ethnicity. however, caribbean black youth appear to be more vulnerable when they perceive high levels of discrimination.","Adolescence is a period of significant developmental changes for all youth. Explorations and commitments with regard to racial or ethnic group membership require further efforts to crystallize an ethnic identity among many youth of color .

3,"adenotonsillectomy (at) is among the most common pediatric surgical procedures and is performed as often for obstructive sleep apnea (osa) as for recurrent tonsillitis. this study compared behavioral, cognitive, and sleep measures in healthy control children recruited from a university hospital based pediatric general surgery clinic with children who had osa (at/osa+) and children who did not have osa (at/osa) scheduled for at. parental ratings of behavior, sleep problems, and snoring, along with specific cognitive measures (i.e., short term attention, visuospatial problem solving, memory, arithmetic) reflected greater difficulties for at children compared with controls. differences between the at/osa and control groups were larger and more consistent across test measures than were those between the at/osa+ and control groups. the fact that worse outcomes were not clearly demonstrated for the at/osa+ group compared with the other groups was not expected based on existing literature. this counterintuitive finding may reflect a combination of factors, including age, daytime sleepiness, features of sleep disordered breathing too subtle to show on standard polysomnography, and academic or environmental factors not collected in this study. these results underscore the importance of applying more sophisticated methodologies to better understand the salient pathophysiology of childhood sleep disordered breathing.","The groups also showed no baseline differences on parent and teacher behavior rating scales. Findings for mood problems appear less consistent, however .

4,"the performance of high sensitivity x ray imagers may be limited by additive instrumentation noise rather than by quantum noise when operated at the low exposure rates used in fluoroscopic procedures. the equipment invasive instrumentation noise measures (in terms of electrons) are generally difficult to make and are potentially not as helpful in clinical practice as would be a direct radiological representation of such noise that may be determined in the field. in this work, we define a clinically relevant representation for instrumentation noise in terms of noise equivalent detector entrance exposure, termed the instrumentation noise equivalent exposure (inee), which can be determined through experimental measurements of noise variance or signal to noise ratio (snr). the inee was measured for various detectors, thus demonstrating its usefulness in terms of providing information about the effective operating range of the various detectors. a simulation study is presented to demonstrate the robustness of this metric against post processing, and its dependence on inherent detector blur. these studies suggest that the inee may be a practical gauge to determine and compare the range of quantum limited performance for clinical x ray detectors of different design, with the implication that detector performance at exposures below the inee will be instrumentation noise limited rather than quantum noise limited.","Similar to Roos, several other authors have used an approach of plotting SNR versus exposure to determine an approximate threshold exposure (, ). A simulation study is presented that demonstrates the effect of detector blur and image post processing blur on INEE measurements. Flat panel detectors (FPD) based on thin film transistor arrays are now considered as an alternative to conventional x ray image intensifiers (XII) because they provide geometric distortion and veiling glare free images .Therefore, the limits of a detector technology are readily identified with a clinically relevant measurethe detector entrance exposure. For image acquisition, the x ray tube voltage was set to 72 kVp for each detector and, in order to achieve very low exposure to the detector (as required for the SNR method), the x ray beam was attenuated by using combinations of filter materials such that the first half value layers of the x ray spectra used for the MA, the MAF, the HSMAF and the XII detectors were 8.2 mm Al, 10.2 mm Al, 10.1 mm Al and 10.3 mm Al, respectively. To eliminate grid lines, the antiscatter grid was removed from the XII input.In conclusion, the INEE metric provides the threshold exposure at which the detector instrumentation noise exceeds the quantum noise. The simulation study presented here has shown that smoothing (which is linear and performed on the acquired images as a post processing step) does not change the measured value of the INEE. A simple formal treatment of the instrumentation noise in terms of the detector entrance exposure was developed and applied to three custom designed CCD fiber optic based systems of different sensitivities and to a commercial x ray image intensifier system, and was compared with values for a flat panel detector system reported by other investigators.","Similar to Roos, several other authors have used an approach of plotting SNR versus exposure to determine an approximate threshold exposure (, ).

5,"objective the purpose was to identify and describe the patterns of asthma control perception in relation to actual symptom reports in adolescents and to compare the group with accurate control perception with those of inaccurate perception in relationship to sociodemographic characteristics, illness related factors and psychosocial factors. methods a sample of adolescents from thru years of age participated in the study. patterns of control perception were constructed based on participants rating of their perception of asthma control and self reported asthma symptoms using latent class analysis. anovas and multinomial logistic regressions were computed for group comparisons. results participants were classified into four groups according to the patterns of control perception. accurate groups were divided into either the well controlled (62%) or the poorly controlled group (7%), and inaccurate groups were manifested in accuracy either with nighttime symptoms (25%) or daytime symptoms (6%). minority participants (p<.001) or those with low socioeconomic status (p<.001) were more likely to be represented in the inaccurate group than their counterparts. the well controlled accurate group consistently reported higher asthma related knowledge (p=.02), more positive attitude toward asthma (p<.001), fewer barriers to self management (p=.04) and higher quality of life (p<.001) than the inaccurate group. conclusion this study demonstrated that accuracy of asthma control perception can be classified into four criteria based on patterns of various asthma symptoms. adolescents tendency toward underperception was evident. the inaccurate groups are at greater risk for psychosocial impairments. this study underscores the importance of an intervention that improves the accuracy of asthma control perception in adolescents while promoting psychosocial wellbeing among adolescents with inaccurate perception.","However, literature is limited regarding the extent to which the accuracy of control perception is associated with psychosocial factors .

6,"background quantitative endophenotypes are needed to better understand the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. the psychobiological model of temperament and character suggests that personality traits are heritable and regulated by brain systems influencing schizophrenia susceptibility. thus, measures of temperament and character may serve as schizophrenia related endophenotypes in individuals with schizophrenia and their non psychotic siblings. methods individuals with schizophrenia (n=35), their non psychotic siblings (n=34), controls (n=63), and their siblings (n=56) participated in a study of the clinical, cognitive and neuromorphological characteristics of schizophrenia. a mixed model approach assessed group differences on the temperament and character inventory (tci). neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology were correlated with the tci. configurations of tci domains were examined using a generalized linear model. results individuals with schizophrenia and their siblings had higher harm avoidance than controls and their siblings. individuals with schizophrenia had lower self directedness and cooperativeness, and higher self transcendence than their non psychotic siblings, controls, and the siblings of controls. neurocognition was not related to temperament and character in individuals with schizophrenia or either control group. in non psychotic siblings, self directedness and cooperativeness were correlated with working memory and crystallized iq. conclusion evidence supports harm avoidance as a schizophrenia related endophenotype. an increased risk of schizophrenia may be associated with asociality (configured as high harm avoidance and low reward dependence), schizotypy (configured as low self directedness, low cooperativeness, and high self transcendence), and neurocognitive deficits (poor executive functioning, working/episodic memory, attention, and low iq). the non psychotic siblings demonstrated features of a mature character profile including strong crystallized iq, which may confer protection against psychopathology.","Research suggests that higher levels of cognition and fewer positive and negative symptoms were related to greater openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness, and lower neuroticism in schizophrenia patients .

12,"dithiocarbamates (dtcs) can be formed by the in situ condensation of polar alkylamines with cs2, and assembled into dithiocarbamate anchored monolayers (dams) on au substrates in aqueous solutions. primary and secondary amines can both be used to prepare dtcs, but have significant differences in their reactivities and product stabilities. ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy provides a convenient method for monitoring in situ dtc formation as well as the formation of potential byproducts. the kinetics of dam assembly on au substrates as measured by second harmonic generation (shg) indicated first order rate processes and saturation coverages similar to those of alkanethiols on au. however, the rate of adsorption did not change with dtc concentration in a manner expected of langmuir kinetics, and is attributed to the competitive adsorption of alkylammonium counterions to the freshly oxidized au substrate. these analyses establish a practical range of conditions for preparing dams from polar amines using in situ dtc formation.","The phenomenal versatility of chemisorptive SAMs is limited only by their compatibility with the environments of their intended applications. Chemisorption provides directionality to self assembled monolayers (SAMs), enabling one to engineer surface properties based on molecular design principles. We attribute this to the chemical reactivity of the substrate itself, namely the presence of a transient but reactive Au oxide formed during surface cleaning .If this factor is taken into account, then the DAM structure is more likely dominated by DTC chemisorption to threefold hollow sites . A widely accepted model of alkanethiol SAM assembly features an initial Langmuir adsorption, followed by a slower reorganization step. The high sulfur count again indicates the substantial coadsorption of sulfur containing byproducts, likely generated in this case by the decomposition of ME DTC during SHG analysis .The in situ condensation of alkylamines and CS2 into DTCs offers a practical and versatile method for DAM assembly on Au surfaces.

13,"neuroimaging techniques have lead to significant advances in our understanding of the neurobiology and treatment of drug addiction in humans. the capability to conduct parallel studies in nonhuman primates and human subjects provides a powerful translational approach to link findings in human and animal research. a significant advantage of nonhuman primate models is the ability to use drug nave subjects in longitudinal designs that document the neurobiological changes that are associated with chronic drug use. moreover, experimental therapeutics can be evaluated in subjects with well documented histories of drug exposure. the in vivo distribution and pharmacokinetics of drug binding in brain have been related to the time course of behavioral effects associated with the addictive properties of stimulants. importantly, the characterization of drug interactions with specific protein targets in brain has identified potential targets for medications development. neuroimaging has proven especially useful in studying the dynamic changes in neuronal function that may be associated with environmental variables. lastly, neuroimaging has been used effectively in nonhuman primates to characterize both transient and long lasting changes in brain chemistry associated with chronic drug exposure. although there is some evidence to suggest neurotoxicity in humans with long histories of stimulant use, parallel studies in nonhuman primates have not identified consistent long term changes in such neurochemical markers. collectively, the results of these studies of nonhuman primates have enhanced our understanding of the neurobiological basis of stimulant addiction and should have a significant impact on efforts to develop medications to treat stimulant abuse.","Species differences in the complex topographical organization of the ventral striatum and its connections with surrounding areas, for example, complicate extrapolations from rodents to primates.

Nearly all mothers knew their child's HIV status, but none of the children were receiving antiretroviral therapy. The 3 supplement groups were: vitamin A alone, vitamin A plus zinc, and multiple vitamins and minerals, including vitamin A and zinc.Although infants progressively abandon breast milk and formula, diversity increases because they replace it with nonmilk sources of protein, snacks, and sweetened beverages.

In this study, we used a locally adapted dietary questionnaire that listed only foods most commonly consumed in the area, rather than all possible foods, and categorized them into 8 common food types.This study reports on 381 children who were part of a randomized trial examining the efficacy of 3 micronutrient supplements, given daily from 6 to 24 mo of age, in reducing diarrhea and respiratory disease prevalence . Nearly all mothers knew their child's HIV status, but none of the children were receiving antiretroviral therapy. The 3 supplement groups were: vitamin A alone, vitamin A plus zinc, and multiple vitamins and minerals, including vitamin A and zinc.Although infants progressively abandon breast milk and formula, diversity increases because they replace it with nonmilk sources of protein, snacks, and sweetened beverages.

16,"fmri studies of recognition memory have often been interpreted to mean that the hippocampus supports recollection and that the adjacent perirhinal cortex supports familiarity. other work suggests that these studies have confounded recollection and familiarity with strong and weak memories. in a source memory study, we used two novel approaches to data analysis that allowed item memory strength and source memory strength to be assessed independently. first, we identified regions in both hippocampus and perirhinal cortex where activity varied as a function of subsequent item memory strength while source memory strength was held constant at chance levels. second, we identified regions in prefrontal cortex where activity varied as a function of subsequent source memory strength while item memory strength was held constant. these findings suggest that activity in the medial temporal lobe is predictive of subsequent memory strength, whereas activity in prefrontal cortex is predictive of subsequent recollection.","Recollection involves remembering specific contextual details about a prior learning episode, and familiarity involves simply knowing that an item was presented before. First, we examined changes in fMRI activation during learning related to the subsequent strength of item memory, while source memory strength was held constant at chance levels. Declarative memory depends on the medial temporal lobe (MTL), which includes the hippocampus, the dentate gyrus, the subicular complex, together with the adjacent perirhinal, entorhinal, and parahippocampal cortices .One participant had too few low confidence source responses and was eliminated from this analysis . In , perirhinal activity was identified wihen the analysis included the lower memory strength categories (i.e. forgotten trials) (see Discussion) .

Lastly, medial frontal activation has been implicated in self referential processing , which might promote the organization of study material for subsequent remembering .

17,"upon titration with palmitate, the 1h nmr spectra of metmyoglobin cyanide (mbcn) reveal a selective perturbation of the heme methyl, consistent with a specific interaction of myoglobin (mb) with fatty acid. other detectable hyperfine shifted resonances of the heme group remain unchanged. mb also enhances fatty acid solubility, as reflected in a more intense methylene peak of palmitate in mb than in tris buffer. ligand binding analysis indicates an apparent palmitate dissociation constant (kd) of m. these results suggest that mb can bind fatty acid and may have a role in facilitating fatty acid transport in the cell.","The physiology canon asserts that Mb serves as an O2 stores or facilitates O2 transport.

18,a simplified method for quantitative analysis of fatty acids in various matrices by gas chromatography is proposed as an alternative to the conventional method and the variables of the protocol examined to optimize the processing conditions. the modified method involves direct methylation of fatty acids in homogenized samples with boron trihalide (bf3 or bcl3 in methanol) followed by extraction with hexane. the addition of hexane to the reaction mixture after the methylation process can enhance the efficiency of fatty acid methylation and is critical for those samples that contain high levels of triglycerides. a mechanism underlying this effect is proposed.,"In this study, we examined the influence of the type of BX3 used, namely BF3 and BCl3, before comparing the results of the simplified method with those obtained by the conventional multiple step protocol in the analysis of certified and non certified materials.

The type of catalyst (BCl3 or BF3) was found to have little effect on the formation of FAME.

23,"neurons in visual cortex are linked by an extensive network of lateral connections. to study the effect of these connections on neural responses, we recorded spikes and local field potentials (lfps) from multi electrode arrays that were implanted in monkey and cat primary visual cortex. spikes at each location generated outward traveling lfp waves. when the visual stimulus was absent or had low contrast, these lfp waves had large amplitudes and traveled over long distances. their effect was strong: lfp traces at any site could be predicted by the superposition of waves that were evoked by spiking in a 1.5 mm radius. as stimulus contrast increased, both the magnitude and the distance traveled by the waves progressively decreased. we conclude that the relative weight of feedforward and lateral inputs in visual cortex is not fixed, but rather depends on stimulus contrast. lateral connections dominate at low contrast, when spatial integration of signals is perhaps most beneficial.","The LFP, especially in the absence of a sensory stimulus, is a highly variable signal characteristic of ongoing activity. The relative strength of these two signals remains controversial. One view holds that the responses of V1 neurons are largely determined by local processing of thalamic inputs , whereas another view states that V1 responses are substantially shaped by long range lateral connections .None To further test the causal relationship between spikes and LFP waves, we asked whether the LFP signal at one site could be predicted from spiking at remote locations. This is a demanding test, as the LFP in the absence of a stimulus is a highly variable signal and, to the best of our knowledge, no computational model has succeeded in predicting it quantitatively . This prediction was markedly accurate and the accuracy increased as the area over which the spikes were integrated extended to encompass a larger cortical region .Alternative explanations for the traveling waves, based on common input from outside V1, seem much less likely. The exact cellular and network mechanisms that are involved in modulating lateral connectivity are unknown and require further study. Thus, sampling 400 m intervals allows for estimates of postsynaptic activity in neuronal populations that are largely nonoverlapping .","The LFP, especially in the absence of a sensory stimulus, is a highly variable signal characteristic of ongoing activity.

25,"previous studies show that older adults have poorer immediate recall for language but the reason is unknown. older adults may recall fewer chunks from working memory, or may have difficulty binding words together to form multi unit chunks. we examined these two hypotheses by presenting types of spoken sentences for immediate free recall, differing in the number and length of chunks per trial: short, simple sentences; such sentences; compound sentences, each incorporating two meaningful, short sentences; and random word lists, each under a sentence like intonation. older adults recalled words from (accessed) fewer clauses than young adults, but there was no aging deficit in the degree of completion of clauses that were accessed. an age related decline in working memory capacity measured in chunks appears to account for deficits in memory for spoken language.","Prior research has demonstrated that both the number and size of chunks that are concurrently stored in working memory can be estimated from task performance (e.g., ). recently provided evidence from the serial recall of word lists that the number of chunks that can be held in working memory decreases considerably in adult aging, and that the ability to retain multi word chunks also decreases somewhat. It is possible to ask, then, whether the number and/or size of chunks changes with age in adulthood.Several findings provide insight into which types of language stimuli young and older adults will be more likely to recall, as well as where aging deficits might be found using the measures described above. At any rate, such multi sentence chunking would not be expected to change the conclusions about age effects, only the specific capacity estimates . Each of the eight trials began with a 1000 ms fixation on the computer screen (the word Ready) to alert participants.These studies, however, contained a small number of stimuli (e.g., six letters or numbers) that may not greatly tax working memory or provide a need to chunk items together . This scoring essentially treated the four random sentence condition as a control to contrast with the use of sentence structure in the four short sentence condition . Older adults should encounter difficulty in binding two words together into a cohesive unit, resulting in the observed decline in chunk size estimates.","Prior research has demonstrated that both the number and size of chunks that are concurrently stored in working memory can be estimated from task performance (e.g., ). recently provided evidence from the serial recall of word lists that the number of chunks that can be held in working memory decreases considerably in adult aging, and that the ability to retain multi word chunks also decreases somewhat.

26,"we demonstrate histologically sub retinal drusenoid debris in three aged human eyes, two of them affected by age related maculopathy. by postmortem fundus examination, the lesions appeared drusen like, i.e., they were pale spots apparently at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium (rpe). light and electron microscopy revealed aggregations of membranous debris, the principal constituent of soft drusen, in the sub retinal space. immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy confirmed the presence of molecules typically associated with drusen (positive for unesterified cholesterol, apoe, complement factor h, and vitronectin) without evidence for molecules associated with photoreceptors (lectins and opsins), mller cells (glial fibrillary acid protein and cellular retinal binding protein, cralpb), or rpe (cralpb). the fact that a drusenoid material, sharing some markers with conventional drusen, can occur on opposite faces of the rpe, suggests deranged polarity of normally highly vectorial processes for basolateral secretion from rpe, and that overproduction of secreted materials and direction of secretion are independently specified processes. in the future, drusenoid sub retinal debris might be more frequently revealed by emerging high resolution imaging techniques.","Drusen type, size, number, total area and/or degree of confluence are risk factors for the development of age related maculopathy (ARM), the leading cause of irreversible blindness in people over the age of 65 years .

28,"innate immune responses mediated by toll like receptors (tlrs), a class of pattern recognition receptors, play a critical role in the defense against microbial pathogens. however, excessive tlr mediated responses result in sepsis, autoimmunity, and chronic inflammation. to prevent deleterious activation of tlrs, cells have evolved multiple mechanisms that inhibit innate immune reactions. stimulation of tlrs induces the expression of the gene encoding the mitogen activated protein kinase (mapk) phosphatase 1 (mkp 1), a nuclear localized dual specificity phosphatase that preferentially dephosphorylates p38 mapk and c jun n terminal kinase (jnk), resulting in the attenuation of tlr triggered production of proinflammatory cytokines. mkp 1 is posttranslationally modified by multiple mechanisms, including phosphorylation. a study now demonstrates that mkp 1 is also acetylated on a key lysine residue following stimulation of tlrs. acetylation of mkp 1 promotes the interaction of mkp 1 with its substrate p38 mapk, which results in dephosphorylation of p38 mapk and the inhibition of innate immunity.","HDAC inhibitors induce the expression of a subset of genes involved in cell growth arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis, which accounts for the antitumor effects of these compounds .

29,"birdsong is a learned behavior remarkable for its high degree of stereotypy. nevertheless, adult birds display substantial rendition by rendition variation in the structure of individual song elements or syllables. previous work suggests that some of this variation is actively generated by the avian basal ganglia circuitry for purposes of motor exploration. however, it is unknown whether and how natural variations in premotor activity drive variations in syllable structure. here, we recorded from the premotor nucleus ra (robust nucleus of the arcopallium) in bengalese finches and measured whether neural activity co varied with syllable structure across multiple renditions of individual syllables. we found that variations in premotor activity were significantly correlated with variations in the acoustic features (pitch, amplitude, and spectral entropy) of syllables in roughly a quarter of all cases. in these cases, individual neural recordings predicted 8.5 +/ 0.3% (mean +/ s.e.) of the behavioral variation, and in some cases accounted for 25% or more of trial by trial variations in acoustic output. the prevalence and strength of neuron behavior correlations indicate that each acoustic feature is controlled by a large ensemble of neurons that vary their activity in a coordinated fashion. additionally, we found that correlations with pitch (but not other features) were predominantly positive in sign, supporting a model of pitch production based on the anatomy and physiology of the vocal motor apparatus. collectively, our results indicate that trial by trial variations in spectral structure are indeed under central neural control at the level of ra, consistent with the idea that such variation reflects motor exploration.","Birdsong is an excellent model system for studying the control of behavioral variation.

30,"auditory cortical processing in primates has been proposed to be divided into two parallel processing streams, a caudal spatial stream and a rostral non spatial stream. previous single neuron studies have indicated that neurons in the rostral lateral belt respond selectively to vocalization stimuli, whereas imaging studies have indicated that selective vocalization processing first occurs in higher order cortical areas. to test the dual stream hypothesis and to find evidence to account for the difference between the electrophysiological and imaging results, we recorded the responses of single neurons in core and belt auditory cortical fields to both forward and reversed vocalizations. we found that there was little difference in the overall firing rate of neurons across different cortical areas or between forward and reversed vocalizations. however, more information was carried in the overall firing rate for forward vocalizations compared to reversed vocalizations in all areas except the rostral field of the core (area r). these results are consistent with the imaging results and are inconsistent with early rostral cortical areas being involved in selectively processing vocalization stimuli based on a firing rate code. they further suggest that a more complex processing scheme is in play in these early auditory cortical areas.","In this study the responses of single neurons to four con specific vocalization exemplars presented in forward and time reversed directions were recorded in five cortical areas; the primary auditory cortex (A1), rostral field (R), caudo medial (CM), caudo lateral (CL) and middle lateral (ML) areas.

34,"purpose renal cell carcinoma (rcc) is rare in patients <40 years old and conflicting data regarding presentation and outcome are present in the literature. we reviewed our experience with young rcc patients comparing them to older counterparts. methods we identified 1,720 patients 18 79 years old managed with partial or radical nephrectomy for rcc between and 2005. patients were grouped according to age and outcome analyses were conducted. results among the 1,720 rcc patients, there were (5%), (39%), and (56%) patients aged <40, 40 59, and 60 79 years old, respectively. there were no significant differences in sex, tumor size, tnm stage, or multifocality by age group. however, patients <40 years old were significantly more likely to present with symptomatic tumors (p=0.028). additionally, there were significant differences in histology by age (p<0.001); chromophobe histology decreased while papillary histology increased with age. despite similar tumor sizes in each age group, the percentage of patients treated with partial nephrectomy declined with age; 49% of patients <40 years old were treated with partial nephrectomy compared with 35% and 30% of patients aged 40 59 and 60 79 years old, respectively (p<0.001). with a median follow up of 2.6 years (range 0 14.5), we did not observe a significant difference in cancer specific survival according to age (p=0.17). conclusions younger rcc patients are more likely to have symptomatic tumors with chromophobe histology although prognosis appears similar across age groups. older patients are more likely to be treated with radical nephrectomy and this requires careful scrutiny for current clinical practice.","Collectively, these discordant findings suggest that further data is warranted. Thus, observations of younger patients with RCC are limited with approximately 700 patients <40 years old reported in the current literature .

43,"objectives the preschools that children attend influence their physical activity level. but, little is known about which characteristics of a preschool may influence the physical activity of children. the purpose of this study was to examine policies and characteristics of preschools and the extent to which they influence the physical activity of 3 to 5 year old children during the preschool day. methods a total of children from preschools wore actigraph (pensacola, fl) accelerometers an average of 8.1 hours (sd=1.5) per day for 5.5 days (sd=2.1). a researcher completed the early childhood environment rating scale revised edition (ecers r) for each preschool to access quality. classrooms and playgrounds were measured, and the preschool director was interviewed about physical activity policies. for each policy or characteristic, preschools were divided into two groups based on whether or not the characteristic/policy was presumed to promote physical activity (ppa) or not promote physical activity (npa). results children spent fewer minutes per hour in sedentary activity and more minutes per hour in moderate to vigorous physical activity (mvpa) in preschools that had higher quality scores, less fixed playground equipment, more portable playground equipment, lower electronic media use, and larger playgrounds. five preschools had all five of these characteristics, and children in those preschools had significantly higher mvpa minutes per hour and lower sedentary minutes per hour compared to children in the other preschools. conclusions all preschools can encourage physical activity by providing inexpensive portable playground equipment, limiting the number of children using fixed equipment and the number of children on the playground at one time, and limiting electronic media use. children in the top five physical activity promoting preschools accumulated more than minutes per day of mvpa as compared to the children in the other preschools who accumulated less than minutes per day of mvpa.","Experts have concluded that children 3 to 5 years of age should participate in both free play and structured physical activity.

44,"the mechanical properties of triton permeabilized ventricular preparations isolated from 4, and 24 month old f344 rats were analyzed to provide information about the molecular mechanisms that lead to age related increases in diastolic myocardial stiffness in these animals. passive stiffness (measured in solutions with minimal free ca2+) did not change with age. this implies that the aging associated dysfunction is not due to changes in titin or collagen molecules. ca2+ activated preparations exhibited a characteristic short range force response: force rose rapidly until the muscle reached its elastic limit and less rapidly thereafter. the elastic limit increased from 0.43 0.01 % l0 (where l0 is the initial muscle length) in preparations from 4 month old animals to 0.49 0.01 % l0 in preparations from 24 month old rats (p<0.001, anova). relative short range force was defined as the maximum force produced during the short range response normalized to the prevailing tension. this parameter increased from 0.110 0.002 to 0.142 0.002 over the same age span (p<0.001, anova). analytical gel electrophoresis showed that the maximum stiffness of the preparations during the short range response and the relative short range force increased (p=0.031 and p=0.005 respectively) with the relative content of slow myosin heavy chain molecules. elastic limit values did not correlate with myosin isoform content. simulations based on these results suggest that attached myosin heavy chain cross bridges are stiffer than links formed by myosin heads. in conclusion, elevated content of stiffer myosin heavy chain molecules may contribute to aging associated increases in myocardial stiffness.","Age related changes in titin based stiffness are probably unlikely in this animal model because rats already express the vast majority (>95%) of their titin as the shorter, stiffer N2B isoform . This is termed diastolic dysfunction . However it is possible that aging associated changes in other sarcomeric proteins could contribute to myocardial stiffening .All experiments were performed at 15C using SLControl software . Cross sectional area (1.62 1.27 108 m2) was estimated from the video images by assuming that each preparation had a circular profile. The average length of the myocardial sample once the sarcomere length had been set was 574 25 m.This difference signal (, middle panel) was then analyzed to ascertain whether its peak value exceeded a threshold set to 4 times the mean noise level in the experimental force trace. It was also straightforward to implement automatically and (since it did not require user intervention) was unlikely to be affected by user bias. this parameter increased from 0.110 0.002 to 0.142 0.002 over the same age span (p<0.001, anova).","Age related changes in titin based stiffness are probably unlikely in this animal model because rats already express the vast majority (>95%) of their titin as the shorter, stiffer N2B isoform .

45,"objectives parenteral nutrition associated liver disease (pnald) is a major problem with prolonged tpn administration. our laboratory previously demonstrated significant changes in the expression of mdr1 and mdr2, two hepatocyte transporters, in a tpn mouse model. our present study hypothesized that these changes would lead to functional changes in the liver, and would contribute to the development of liver dysfunction. methods mice received either intravenous saline and standard chow or tpn with or without intravenous lipids. functional assays were performed after days of infusion. results tpn with lipids led to a significant increase in serum bile acid levels, consistent with an early state of pnald. use of tpn without lipids prevented elevation in bile acid levels. in both tpn groups, mdr2 expression was significantly (68%) lower than controls; and bile phosphatidylcholine content, a functional measure of mdr2, was 40% less than controls. mdr1 expression in the tpn with lipid group was 31% higher than controls; while in the tpn without lipids mice there was no significant change. hepatocyte extrusion of rhodamine dye, a measure of mdr1 function, declined only in tpn with lipids. ppar expression decreased in both tpn groups. fenofibrate given with tpn resulted in an increased expression of mdr1 and mdr2, and functionally increased hepatocyte rhodamine extrusion and presence of bile phosphatidylcholine in the tpn with lipid group. conclusions the study shows that tpn led to alterations in the function of mdr1 and mdr2 expressed proteins. the changes help in the understanding of the mechanisms leading to pnald; and suggest that fibrate administration may palliate these changes.","This disorder may be seen at all ages, but is most prevalent in premature infants (, ).

The interaction between the community and the individual is different for young men and young women; often young men have greater freedom and young women are relegated to a vulnerable position.",0.4626865671641791,0.17,0.29834301666087687,0.4626865671641791,0.17,0.29834301666087687
49,"numerous neurosecretory cells are known to secrete more than one peptide, in both vertebrates and invertebrates. these co expressed neuropeptides often originate from differential cleavage of a single large precursor, and are then usually sorted in the regulated pathway into different secretory vesicle classes to allow separable release dynamics. here, we use immuno gold electron microscopy to show that two very different neuropeptides (the nonapeptide crustacean cardioactive peptide (ccap) and the kda heterodimeric bursicon) are co packaged within the same dense core vesicles in neurosecretory neurons in the abdominal ganglia of periplaneta americana. we suggest that this co packaging serves a physiological function in which ccap accelerates the distribution of bursicon to the epidermis after ecdysis to regulate sclerotization of the newly formed cuticle.","Neuropeptides orchestrate numerous complex behaviors in insects.

50,"the study of dendritic spine shape and number has become a standard in the analysis of synaptic transmission anomalies since a considerable number of neuropsychiatric and neurological diseases have their foundation in alterations in these structures. one of the best ways to study possible alterations of dendritic spines is the use of golgi impregnation. although usually the golgi method implies the use of fresh or fixed tissue, here we report the use of golgi cox for the staining of human and animal brain tissue kept frozen for long periods of time. we successfully applied the golgi cox method to human brain tissue stored for up to years in a freezer. the technique produced reliable and reproducible impregnation of dendrites and dendritic spines in different cortical areas. we also applied the same technique to rat brain frozen for up to one year, obtaining the same satisfactory results. the fact that golgi cox can be successfully applied to this type of tissue adds a new value for hundreds of frozen human or animal brains kept in the freezers of the laboratories, that otherwise would not be useful for anything else. researchers other than neuroanatomists, i.e. in fields such as biochemistry and molecular biology can also benefit from a simple and reliable technique that can be applied to tissue left from their primary experiments.","Fresh frozen tissue has many applications in molecular biology and biochemistry experiments (in situ hybridization, western blot, DNA or RNA extraction, etc) but has little application in neuroanatomy studies because of the lack of good morphology due to the preservation conditions. They were first described by Cajal as small thorns that projected from the dendrites of cerebellar Purkinje cells . Moreover, it is important to determine if those alterations are due to the disease itself or are caused by the use of antipsychotic drugs.To perform the Golgi impregnation, a Golgi Cox based kit (FD Rapid GolgiStain) was purchased from FDNeurotechnologies, Inc. (Ellicott City, MD, USA). Only some thickenings in these processes can be observed . After the samples were thawed or subjected to the different pretreatments, they were immersed in the chromation solution which consists of a mixture of mercury chloride + potassium dichromate + potassium chromate, following the instructions of the manufacturer.That said it is clear that this technique is still a very useful tool for the study of the normal anatomy as well as the pathology of the central nervous system, and can provide us with an estimate of the functional status of a particular nucleus or brain region. As an example, in the case of schizophrenia, the ability to use frozen stored tissue from patients that were not exposed to antipsychotic drugs will allow the study of the dynamics of the dendritic spines without the confounding effects of the medication.

52,"previous studies have identified an increased incidence of bicuspid aortic valve (bav) in patients with ventricular septal defect (vsd). because endocardial cushion remodeling contributes to both the formation of semilunar valves and ventricular septation, we hypothesized that examination of humans with bav and vsd would identify a specific vsd type. we evaluated vsd type in pediatric patients diagnosed with bav and vsd (n=82) and compared findings to patients diagnosed with vsd and normal aortic valve morphology (n=429). vsd type was described as conoventricular, muscular, inlet or conoseptal using a clinical taxonomy. based on the contribution of the outflow tract endocardial cushions to the membranous ventricular septum, we expected patients with bav to have conoventricular vsd. in both patient groups, conoventricular vsd was most common; however, the prevalence was not significantly different when bav patients were compared to those with normal aortic valve morphology (67% vs. 57%, p=0.11). the primary finding of this study is that despite a developmental link between semilunar valve formation and ventricular septation during cardiogenesis, there is no clear association between bav and vsd type. this may be due to phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of bav and vsd, other modifying factors as manifested by differences in associated cvm, as well as limitations of the clinical taxonomy of vsd.","However, it remains unknown which type of VSD may be associated with BAV .

53,"we investigated the binding of a naturally occurring antibiotic, actinonin, to the ni2+ reconstituted recombinant form of e. coli peptide deformylase (pdfec) via isothermal titration microcalorimetry. the binding data conformed to both exothermic and endothermic phases with magnitudes of g, h, and ts being equal to 12, 2.7, and 9.3, and 8.7, 3.9, and 12.6 kcal/mol, respectively. evidently, although both phases are dominated by favorable entropic changes, the exothermic phase has about 6.7 kcal/mol enthalpic advantage over the endothermic phase. we observed that the removal of bound ni2+ from pdfec abolished the exothermic phase without affecting the endothermic phase, but it was regained upon addition of zn2+. in conjunction with metal analysis data, we propose that the recombinant form of pdfec is expressed in two stable conformational states that yield markedly distinct itc profiles (i.e., exothermic versus endothermic) upon interaction with actinonin. the existence of two conformational states of pdfec is further supported by the observation of two distinct and independent transitions during the thermal unfolding of the enzyme. in addition, the thermodynamic data reveals that the formation of the pdfec actinonin complex results in the transfer of one h+ from the enzyme phase to the bulk solvent at ph 6.3. both exothermic and endothermic phases produce highly negative cp values, but there is no apparent enthalpy entropy compensation effect upon formation of the pdfec actinonin complex. in view of the known structural features of the enzyme, arguments are presented that the alternative conformational states of pdfec are modulated by the metal ligation at the enzyme site.","Several structures of PDF have been determined via NMR and X ray crystallographic methods in the absence and presence of inhibitors. Due to the resistance to antibiotics, many drugs that were once mainstay therapeutics have become ineffective and are no longer utilized. The latter is replaced by the metal binding groups of putative inhibitors.The dependence of the two conformations on the identity of the catalytic metal center will be discussed in the next section . Using the standard state being equal to 1.0 M, G and S for the binding of actinonin to PDFEc were calculated to be 8.8 kcal mol1 and 41.4 cal mol1 K1, respectively . The latter values are in good agreement with the thermodynamic parameters obtained for the titration of the native enzyme .Thus, it could easily compete with the physiological Fe2+ in vivo prior to the replacement of the latter by Ni2+ during purification. Such analysis revealed that our enzyme preparation contained a nearly equal amount (i.e., mole fraction) of both Ni2+ and Zn2+. However, as the titration progressed, the exothermic peaks decreased in magnitude (as expected for the increased occupancy of PDFEc sites by actinonin), but to our surprise, subsequent injections of actinonin started producing endothermic peaks (upward spikes).","Several structures of PDF have been determined via NMR and X ray crystallographic methods in the absence and presence of inhibitors.

56,"the auditory scene is dynamic, changing from min to the next as sound sources enter and leave our space. how does the brain resolve the problem of maintaining neural representations of the distinct yet changing sound sources? we used an auditory streaming paradigm to test the dynamics of multiple sound source representation, when switching between integrated and segregated sound streams. the mismatch negativity (mmn) component of event related potentials was used as index of change detection to observe stimulus driven modulation of the ongoing sound organization. probe tones were presented randomly within ambiguously organized sound sequences to reveal whether the neurophysiological representation of the sounds was integrated (no mmn) or segregated (mmn). the pattern of results demonstrated context dependent responses to a single tone that was modulated in dynamic fashion as the auditory environment rapidly changed from integrated to segregated sounds. this suggests a rapid form of auditory plasticity in which the longer term sound context influences the current state of neural activity when it is ambiguous. these results demonstrate stimulus driven modulation of neural activity that accommodates to the dynamically changing acoustic environment.","In this way, MMN reveals effects of the auditory context on change detection (, ; ; ; ; ; ; ).

57,"the hand held gene gun provides a rapid and efficient method of incorporating fluorescent dyes into cells, a technique that is becoming known as diolistics. transporting fluorescent dyes into cells has, in the past, used predominantly injection or chemical methods. the use of the gene gun, combined with the new generation of fluorescent dyes, circumvents some of the problems of using these methods and also enables the study of cells that have proved difficult traditionally to transfect (e.g. those deep in tissues and/or terminally differentiated); in addition, the use of ion or metabolite sensitive dyes provides a route to study cellular mechanisms. diolistics is also ideal for loading cells with optical nanosensors nanometre sized sensors linked to fluorescent probes. here, we discuss the theoretical considerations of using diolistics, the advantages compared with other methods of inserting dyes into cells and the current uses of the technique, with particular consideration of nanosensors.","The more recent versions, such as the BioRad (Helios; http://www.bio rad.com/) hand held gene gun , as well as several custom designed devices [ ], have been used successfully to transfect a wide range of tissues and organisms, including whole animals and plants, bacteria, yeast, mammalian cell lines and even organelles [ ]. The gene guns of today are more sophisticated and, in particular, do not require the use of an evacuated chamber. This procedure severely limited the applications for which the gene gun could be used because samples needed both to be relatively small and resistant to damage when placed in a vacuum.This chemically inert, optically transparent material can be processed to define specific properties of the matrix (e.g. pore size and hydrophobicity) such that these are optimised for the sensing and reporting molecules. Accurate incorporation of the appropriate number of optical nanosensors into the appropriate cells is crucial to obtain an appropriate fluorescent signal. Nanosensors are therefore ideal for monitoring events within tissues or cells or even within some intercellular organelles because they can be located close to the site of action yet cause minimal physical perturbation.We look forward with anticipation to many potential advances . Here, the use of the carbocyanine dyes compares favourably with the use of green fluorescent protein, for example, which requires many hours for gene expression.

60,"summary the mechanisms for delivering components to nerve terminals are diverse and highly regulated. the diversity of kinesin motors alone is insufficient to account for the specificity of delivery. additional specificity and control are contributed by adaptor proteins and associated regulatory molecules. the interaction of cargos with these complexes can confer distinct behaviors on the transport of synaptic organelles. the rich regulatory mechanisms of transport are only now emerging as the cargo motor complexes are defined and subsequent local events that regulate their dynamic relationship are examined. here we review recent studies of kinesin related axonal transport of three crucial synaptic components, piccolo bassoon transport vesicles (ptvs), synaptic vesicle precursors (svps), and mitochondria, and the mechanisms that modulate their transport.","In imac embryos, motoneuron axons extend properly and are guided to and arrest on the appropriate muscle fibers, but synapses cannot form. Once a synapse is established, new components must continue to arrive to replace proteins and organelles targeted for degradation; whether or not the arrival and departure of components are balanced may determine whether a synapse is strengthened, weakened, or in a steady state . Thus axonal transport is more than a monotonous crawl down the axon towards the end .Mitochondrial distribution and axon guidance and growth remains normal in unc 104 and imac mutants demonstrating their specialized role for SVP transport. Thus the activity of the ubiquitin proteasome system may normally reduce wnd activity and thereby allow adaptor cargo complexes to assemble. These accumulations are alleviated by the overexpression of either the ubiquitin hydrolase, fat facets (faf) or the MAPKKK, wallenda (wnd).Mutations of a ubiquitin ligase (highwire), or overexpression of a ubiquitin hydrolase (fat facets) or MAPKKK (wallenda, DLK in mammals) causes dramatic overgrowth of synapses at the neuromuscular junction and homologs in C.elegans also regulate presynaptic development . In the resulting traffic jams, SVPs and other organelles may get stuck despite possessing functional motors .

61,"deficiencies in brain serotonergic neurotransmission, which is in part associated with the alteration of brain serotonin (5 ht) receptors, have been proposed as part of a neurochemical imbalance in affective disorders, including depression. the drugs used for the treatment of these disorders generally act through and/or on the serotonergic system. different animal models of depression have provided researchers with tools to obtain a better understanding of drug actions and possibilities to obtain insight into the neurochemical bases of these disorders. the measurements of the 5 ht1a and 5 ht1b receptor densities in a rat model of depression, flinders sensitive line (fsl) rats, and comparisons with sprague dawley (spd) and flinders resistant line (frl) rats, are reported here. the receptor sites were quantified by autoradiography in more than twenty five distinct brain regions known to have relatively large densities of respective sites. some brain regions (e.g., dental gyrus, septal nucleus) were divided into several parts, according to previously known subdivisions, because of a substantial heterogeneity of these receptors. the densities in the fsl rats (depressed rats) were compared statistically to those in the spd rats. in addition, comparisons were made to the densities in the frl rats (rats not showing depressive symptoms). comparisons were performed with the spd and frl rats because both of these strains have been used as control animals in studies of fsl rats. the results show that the densities of 5 ht1a receptors are not significantly different between the fsl and spd rats, but they are significantly different from the frl rats. 5 ht1a receptor density is significantly higher in the frl rats than the spd rats. the 5 ht1b receptors were significantly greater in the fsl rats than in either the spd or frl rats. in addition, the frl rats have 5 ht1b receptor densities significantly lower in many brain regions than the spd rats. the data presented here, in addition to previously reported differences in regional synthesis between these strains and the effect of acute citalopram on synthesis, suggest that spd rats are likely a more appropriate control than frl rats, when studies of fsl rats are performed with drugs acting directly or indirectly on, or through, the brain serotonergic system. however, comparisons, particularly of neurochemical and/or biological parameters in frl rats, may reveal new insight into the alterations of 5 ht neurotransmission in this animal model of depression and possibly human depression, as well as the elevation of symptoms with treatments. the data also suggest that there could be a different fraction of 5 ht1a receptors in high and low affinity states in these strains, as well as the possibility of different intracellular signalling.","The hypotheses tested in the present study were: This highlights the importance of quantitatively mapping receptor sites through which 5 HT can be modulated .

63,"summary adiponectin is an abundant plasma protein secreted from adipocytes that elicits protective effects in the vasculature and myocardium. in obesity and insulin resistant states, adiponectin levels are reduced and loss of its protective effects might contribute to the excess cardiovascular risk observed in these conditions. adiponectin ameliorates the progression of macrovascular disease in rodent models, consistent with its correlation with improved vascular outcomes in epidemiological studies. the mechanisms of adiponectin signaling are multiple and vary among its cellular sites of action. in endothelial cells, adiponectin enhances production of nitric oxide, suppresses production of reactive oxygen species, and protects cells from inflammation that results from exposure to high glucose levels or tumor necrosis factor, through activation of amp activated protein kinase and cyclic amp dependent protein kinase (also known as protein kinase a) signaling cascades. in the myocardium, adiponectin mediated protection from ischemia reperfusion injury is linked to cyclo oxygenase 2 mediated suppression of tumor necrosis factor signaling, inhibition of apoptosis by amp activated protein kinase, and inhibition of excess peroxynitrite induced oxidative and nitrative stress. in this review, we provide an update of studies of the signaling effects of adiponectin in endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes.","Whether the vasculature related effects mentioned above are mediated by the same receptors that transduce cellular signals from different forms of adiponectin is not known. Rather than focusing on the insulin sensitizing effects of adiponectin, this Review will explore the effects and underlying signaling mechanisms of adiponectin in the microvasculature and myocardium . These high risk patients also have increased concentrations of circulating cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF).Considerable evidence exists that adiponectin achieves its biologic function by activation of AMP kinase and PPAR (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor ), although the precise pathways that lead to their activation remain largely unknown. Serum levels of adiponectin are approximately twofold higher in females than in males, which probably contributes to sex related differences in some of its vascular protective effects . In theseAdipoq / mice, adiponectin replacement therapy, which used globular adiponectin, reversed the inflammatory phenotype of the microvascular endothelium and thus uncovered a potential therapeutic use of globular adiponectin, and possibly other synthetic forms of adiponectin in vivo .Adiponectin is an abundant, oligomeric protein secreted from adipose tissue, which exhibits a variety of remarkable salutary responses that affect insulin resistance and vascular inflammation. The resultant reaction product, peroxynitrite, is extremely cytotoxic and causes oxidative as well as nitrative stress and tissue injury.

65,"use of cone beam computed tomography (cbct) is becoming more frequent. for proper reconstruction, the geometry of the cbct systems must be known. while the system can be designed to reduce errors in the geometry, calibration measurements must still be performed and corrections applied. investigators have proposed techniques using calibration objects for system calibration. in this study, the authors present methods to calibrate a rotary stage cb micro ct (cbct) system using only the images acquired of the object to be reconstructed, i.e., without the use of calibration objects. projection images are acquired using a cbct system constructed in the authors' laboratories. dark and flat field corrections are performed. exposure variations are detected and quantified using analysis of image regions with an unobstructed view of the x ray source. translations that occur during the acquisition in the horizontal direction are detected, quantified, and corrected based on sinogram analysis. the axis of rotation is determined using registration of antiposed projection images. these techniques were evaluated using data obtained with calibration objects and phantoms. the physical geometric axis of rotation is determined and aligned with the rotational axis (assumed to be the center of the detector plane) used in the reconstruction process. the parameters describing this axis agree to within 0.1 mm and 0.3 deg with those determined using other techniques. blurring due to residual calibration errors has a point spread function in the reconstructed planes with a full width at half maximum of less than m in a tangential direction and essentially zero in the radial direction for the rotating object. the authors have used this approach on over acquisitions over the past years and have regularly obtained high quality reconstructions, i.e., without artifacts and no detectable blurring of the reconstructed objects. this self calibrating approach not only obviates calibration runs, but it also provides quality control data for each data set.","This method was evaluated qualitatively in terms of reduction of artifacts in the reconstructed data and quantitatively in terms of the accuracy and precision of the calculated alignments.

67,"the aerosol ot/l phosphatidylcholine/isooctane/water system forms a rigid mesophase that transitions from reverse hexagonal to multilamellar in structure at specific water contents. this study shows that characteristics of ordered liquid crystalline mesophases can be distinguished and imaged in high clarity using cryo field emission scanning electron microscopy (cryo fesem). the reverse hexagonal phase consists of bundles of long cylinders, some with length scales of over m, that are randomly oriented as part of a larger domain. cryo imaging allows the visualization of the intercylinder spacings and the details of transitions from one domain to another. the multilamellar structured mesophase consists of spherical vesicles of nm to m in diameter, with intervening noncrystalline isotropic regions. coexistence regions containing both the reverse hexagonal and lamellar structures are also observed in the transition from the reverse hexagonal to the lamellar phase. these results complement and qualitatively verify our earlier studies with small angle neutron scattering, high field nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and freeze fracture direct imaging transmission electron microscopy. the information is useful in understanding materials templating in these rigid systems.","The microstructure of these mesophases has been previously characterized using small angle neutron scattering (SANS),, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.

68,"animal models have long been used to explore hypotheses regarding the neurobiological substrates of and treatments for psychiatric disorders. early attempts to develop models that mimic the entirety of the diagnostic syndromes in psychiatry have evolved into more appropriate efforts to model specific symptoms. such an approach reflects the facts that even in patients, clinical symptoms transcend diagnostic categories, and the specific etiologies of psychiatric disorders are unknown. an animal model can only be identified adequately by specifying both the manipulation (drug, lesion, strain) used to induce abnormalities and the measure(s) used to characterize them. a wide range of pharmacological, lesion, and developmental manipulations have been combined with various measures of information processing to develop useful animal models that parallel human tests. prepulse inhibition of startle, event related potential (erp) measures of auditory gating, and cambridge neuropsychological test automated battery (cantab) measures of cognition are examples of measures that can be used in both rodents and humans and that are robustly altered in both psychiatric disorders and animals manipulated with appropriate drugs or lesions. the further development of cross species models is critically important, given the new opportunities for the development and registration of specific treatments for the cognitive disorders of schizophrenia that are not ameliorated by available drugs. in moving beyond the focus on psychotic symptoms to the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia, animal models that do not involve manipulations of dopamine d2 receptors but that do utilize information processing measures that are correlated with cognitive disturbances are receiving increased attention. here, selected examples of how cross species measures of psychiatric disorders are developed and validated are discussed. specific animal paradigms that parallel the specific domains of cognition that are altered in schizophrenia provide one focus of the review. another focus includes efforts to develop new human models of psychiatric symptoms that are designed to parallel existing tests used in rodents.","Thus, extremely valuable information could be derived from experimental paradigms based on comparable measures in both preclinical animal models and in early small scale clinical tests.

69,"summary iron is essential for nearly all living organisms. innate immunity effectively restricts iron availability to microbial invaders. some microbes have evolved effective countermeasures that blunt the effect of iron restriction. recent epidemiologic studies have highlighted the potentiating effect of iron on microbial infections. laboratory studies have focused on specific immune mechanisms that mediate iron withholding from microbes constitutively and in response to infections. specialized inflammation regulated proteins chelate iron, trap siderophores, and transport iron or modulate its transport to alter its tissue distribution during infections.","Although iron is abundant in the Earths crust, its natural forms are poorly soluble, and so its supply is often insufficient for optimal growth and function of either microbes or their hosts. Within hours of infection in humans and other vertebrates, concentrations of iron in extracellular fluid and plasma dramatically decrease (hypoferremia).

The role of the Nramp1 gene in innate immunity was originally identified because a mutation in Nramp1 occurring in common mouse strains conferred susceptibility to infection with intracellular microbes that localize in macrophages, including Mycobacteria, Salmonella typhimurium and Leishmania donovanii. Although controversy about the specific mechanism still persists, it now appears that Nramp1 acts by depleting Fe2+, Co2+ and Mn2+ from the phagosome, and thereby starving the phagosomal microbes of these essential nutrients.The potential mechanisms of the role of iron in susceptibility and resistance to infections have been recently reviewed . Surprisingly, iron overload may exacerbate some virus mediated diseases as well, either by facilitating viral replication or by promoting tissue injury or secondary infections .

73,transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (tses or prion diseases) are a rare group of invariably fatal neurodegenerative disorders that affect humans and other mammals. tses are protein misfolding diseases that involve the accumulation of an abnormally aggregated form of the normal host prion protein. they are unique among protein misfolding disorders in that they are transmissible and have different strains of infectious agent that are associated with unique phenotypes in vivo. a wealth of biological and biophysical evidence now suggests that the molecular basis for prion diseases may be encoded by protein conformation. the purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the existing structural information for prion protein within the context of what is known about the biology of prion disease.,"Thus, where PrP sen is higher in helical content, PrP res is higher in sheet content (see below) . PrP res has the same primary sequence as PrP sen but a different secondary structure. The transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are a group of rare neurodegenerative diseases that include scrapie in sheep, chronic wasting disease (CWD) in deer and elk, and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle.At the heart of the spiral model are four strands, termed E1E4, spanning residues within the 116164 region. The helix model proposes that the major conformation changes in the conversion process occur within residues 90112 and extend beyond residue 138 (hamster numbering). Finally, as discussed above, another structure has recently emerged, based upon experimental data obtained from site directed spin labeling and EPR spectroscopy on r PrP res amyloid like fibrils .High resolution structures of PrP sen are well established and have provided useful information regarding the influence of various regions in the PrP sen to PrP res conversion process. In particular, a key loop region composed of residues ~165171 displays structural variations between species and is thought to influence species specific intermolecular contacts, perhaps acting as a nucleation site in the conversion process. However, there are no corresponding structures of PrP res due to problems with insolubility and heterogeneity of purified samples.","Thus, where PrP sen is higher in helical content, PrP res is higher in sheet content (see below) .

76,"we investigated the influence of membrane cholesterol content on preferential and non preferential signaling through the m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor expressed in cho cells. cholesterol depletion by 39% significantly decreased the affinity of m2 receptors for [3h] n methylscopolamine ([3h] nms) binding and increased bmax in intact cells and membranes. membranes displayed two affinity agonist binding sites for carbachol and cholesterol depletion doubled the fraction of high affinity binding sites. in intact cells it also reduced the rate of agonist induced receptor internalization and changed the profile of agonist binding from a single site to two affinity states. cholesterol enrichment by 137% had no effects on carbachol emax of camp synthesis inhibition and on camp synthesis stimulation and inositolphosphates (ip) accumulation at higher agonist concentrations (non preferred pathways). on the other hand, cholesterol depletion significantly increased emax of camp synthesis inhibition or stimulation without change in potency, and decreased emax of ip accumulation. noteworthy, modifications of membrane cholesterol had no effect on membrane permeability, oxidative activity, protein content, or relative expression of gs, gi/o, and gq/11 alpha subunits. these results demonstrate distinct changes of m2 receptor signaling through both preferential and non preferential g proteins consequent to membrane cholesterol depletion that occur at the level of receptor/g protein/effector protein interactions in the cell membrane. the significant decrease of ip accumulation by cholesterol depletion was also observed in cells expressing m3 receptors and by both cholesterol depletion and enrichment in cells expressing m1 receptors indicating relevance of reduced gq/11 signaling for the pathogenesis of alzheimers disease.","To achieve this aim we used human M2 muscarinic receptors heterologously expressed in CHO cells.

In addition, global studies of genome dynamics upon induced gene activation combined with dynamic imaging of nuclear domains will provide significant insight into the regulation of gene activity.",0.38942307692307687,0.08695652173913043,0.22223939717376723,0.38942307692307687,0.08695652173913043,0.22223939717376723
81,"the current gene regulatory network (grn) for the sea urchin embryo pertains to pregastrular specification functions in the endomesodermal territories. here we extend gene regulatory network analysis to the adjacent oral and aboral ectoderm territories over the same period. a large fraction of the regulatory genes predicted by the sea urchin genome project and shown in ancillary studies to be expressed in either oral or aboral ectoderm by 24h are included, though universally expressed and pan ectodermal regulatory genes are in general not. the loci of expression of these genes have been determined by whole mount in situ hybridization. we have carried out a global perturbation analysis in which expression of each gene was interrupted by introduction of morpholino antisense oligonucleotide, and the effects on all other genes were measured quantitatively, both by qpcr and by a new instrumental technology (nanostring technologies ncounter analysis system). at its current stage the network model, built in biotapestry, includes genes encoding transcription factors, genes encoding known signaling ligands, and genes that are yet unknown but are predicted to perform specific roles. evidence emerged from the analysis pointing to distinctive subcircuit features observed earlier in other parts of the grn, including a double negative transcriptional regulatory gate, and dynamic state lockdowns by feedback interactions. while much of the regulatory apparatus is downstream of nodal signaling, as expected from previous observations, there are also cohorts of independently activated oral and aboral ectoderm regulatory genes, and we predict yet unidentified signaling interactions between oral and aboral territories.","This allowed us to begin with a list of most of the possible regulatory players, i.e., most (though not all) regulatory genes expressed in either oral or aboral ectoderm by mid gastrula. Oral vs. aboral regulatory states are not irreversibly committed until late blastula stage. For the pregastrular embryo these are the oral and aboral ectoderm, the boundary region surrounding the oral ectoderm which later becomes the ciliated band, and the neurogenic apical plate (see ).The two methods agree with each other in almost all cases. Thirdly, in addition to the mysteries noted above regarding yet unidentified signaling interactions predicted in the GRN analysis, a great number of other unresolved issues are now in focus.

83,"background neonatal sepsis may stem from local umbilical cord infections. signs of cord infection are common in low resource settings, yet the risk of mortality subsequent to these signs has not been quantified in either developed or developing countries. we compared the risk of mortality between infants with and without signs of umbilical cord infection during a community based trial of chlorhexidine interventions in southern nepal. methods newborns were evaluated for signs of umbilical cord infection (pus, redness, swelling). a nested case control approach was used to estimate the odds of mortality between infants with and without umbilical cord infection as defined by various levels of severity. for each death in the parent trial, controls were selected, matched on sex, treatment group, and number of cord assessments. the main outcome measures were all cause and sepsis specific mortality. results among 23,246 assessed infants, there were deaths. odds of all cause mortality were 46% (898%) higher among infants with redness extending onto the abdominal skin. a nonsignificant increased odds of mortality [odds ratio (or): 2.31; 95% confidence interval (ci): 0.668.10] was observed among infants with severe redness and pus. infections occurring after the third day of life were associated with subsequent risk of all cause (or: 3.11; 95% ci: 1.68 5.74) and sepsis specific (or: 4.63; 95% ci: 2.159.96) mortality. conclusions this study provides evidence that common local signs of cord infection are associated with increased risk of mortality. where exposure of the umbilical cord to potentially invasive pathogens is high, interventions to increase hygienic care of the cord should be promoted and including hand washing, avoiding harmful topical applications, and topical cord antisepsis.","Such guidelines have been made in the absence of specific data linking signs of infection with risk for mortality. The overall proportion of mortality related to local umbilical cord infections that become systemic is unknown, but exposure to pathogens, with or without the development of local signs of omphalitis is thought to be an important proximal event in the pathway to sepsis and death in newborns. Such data support, but do not directly address the hypothesis that local signs of cord infection indicate increased subsequent risk of mortality .Briefly, infants were randomized within clusters to 1 of 2 full body wiping regimens (1 time wipe with either 0.25% chlorhexidine or placebo as soon as possible after birth) and 3 cord care regimens (umbilical stump cleansing with 4.0% chlorhexidine, cleansing with soap and water, or dry cord care only). Workers assessed the cord for signs of infection (pus, redness, swelling) during in home visits throughout the neonatal period. Details of the study population, recruitment, assessment of infection signs, and other procedures have been provided previously.The overall contribution to neonatal mortality because of the associated risk between local signs of cord infection and death is difficult to define, and likely varies substantially across communities. Entry of pathogens into the bloodstream to cause death of the neonate seems to occur either directly, in the absence of local signs of umbilical cord infection (for example, shortly after cutting the cord when the umbilical vessels are patent, and before local signs of infection have developed), or via invasion into the bloodstream at a later date from infected umbilical tissue. The data presented here, although not conclusive, provide supportive evidence for continued risk of mortality as a result of the second pathway (ie, subsequent to local cord infections progressing to systemic infections).","Such guidelines have been made in the absence of specific data linking signs of infection with risk for mortality.

90,"this study examined the effects of prenatal cocaine exposure on infant hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis activity and reactivity at months of infant age. participants were caregiver infant dyads (87 cocaine exposed, not cocaine exposed; 47% boys). maternal behavior, caregiving instability, and infant growth and behavior were assessed, and children's saliva was sampled before, during, and after standardized procedures designed to elicit emotional arousal. results revealed cocaine exposed infants had a high amplitude trajectory of cortisol reactivity compared to non cocaine exposed infants. infant gender and caregiving instability moderated this association. the findings support a dual hazard vulnerability model and have implications for evolutionary developmental theories of individual differences in biological sensitivity to context.","Chronic cocaine exposure is also associated with chronic fetal stress due to vasoconstriction of arteries in the uterus resulting in hypoxia and increases in fetal catecholamine release in response to hypoxia. Studies have shown that chronically elevated levels of cortisol can have deleterious effects on the brain, including deficits in memory, learning, state regulating capacities, and socioemotional development . Some explanatory mechanisms would propose higher cortisol reactivity as a function of prenatal cocaine exposure, whereas others would propose the opposite.The saliva in the cotton roll was expressed into a storage vial using a 10 cc needleless syringe. The infant was measured and weighed, and the mother was interviewed. Three measures of growth were used in this study: birth weight (in grams), birth length (in centimeters), and head circumference (in centimeters).In the case of cortisol, this involves a negative association between the initial or pretask level of cortisol and the magnitude of change. Pearson correlations were computed to examine the associations among the cortisol values. The correlation between two adjacent samples was quite high, ranging from .71 (for the correlation between Time 3 and Time 4 samples) to .76 (for the correlation between Time 1 and Time 2), p < .001.","Chronic cocaine exposure is also associated with chronic fetal stress due to vasoconstriction of arteries in the uterus resulting in hypoxia and increases in fetal catecholamine release in response to hypoxia.

91,"there has been little attention given to the relationship between variations in normal craniofacial morphology and swallowing physiology. this preliminary investigation evaluated the relationship between the frankfort mandibular plane angle (fma) and hyoid displacement during swallowing. hyoid movement was evaluated during 12 ml and 24 ml swallows of liquid barium in healthy subjects (aged to years, median years). lateral projection videoflurography was utilized. positions of the hyoid at maximum forward displacement, maximum upward displacement, start position, and ending position were determined using image analysis software. the mean fma was 28.92 4.08 o (mean sd, range to 34). a pearson correlation ( 0.05) demonstrated that hyoid forward displacement was significantly inversely correlated with the fma (r=.68, p=0.015 (12 ml) and r=.72, p=0.009 (24 ml); thus the greater the fma, the smaller was the hyoid forward displacement. upward displacement of the hyoid was not significantly correlated with fma for 12 ml (r= 0.41, p=0.55) or 24 ml swallows (r=0.21, p=0.512). additionally, there was no significant correlation between hyoid starting or ending positions. in conclusion, the results of this preliminary study suggest that normal variations in morphology, as measured by the fma, may influence hyoid movement and therefore affect the swallowing physiology.","[4, 5].

92,"time based prospective memory (pm) has been found to be negatively affected by aging, possibly as a result of declining frontal lobe (fl) function. despite a clear retrospective component to pm tasks, the medial temporal lobes (mtl) are thought to play only a secondary role in successful task completion. the present study investigated the role of the fls and mtls in time based pm, as well as their involvement in clock monitoring, plan generation, and time estimation, each of which may play a role in the execution of time based pm tasks. based upon their scores on composite measures of fl and mtl function, older adults were divided into four groups, and were then tested on a time based laboratory pm task. overall age effects were also assessed and each of the four groups was compared to a group of younger adults. high frontal functioning participants demonstrated better prospective memory than low frontal functioning participants, and were not distinguishable from younger adults. older adults with high mtl scores performed significantly better than those with low mtl scores, but only if they were also high in fl function. fl function, but not mtl function, predicted patterns of clock monitoring, quality of plans generated to assist in time based pm performance, and the accuracy of time estimation. again, on each of these measures the performance of the high frontal group was equivalent to that of the younger adults. the results of this study suggest that it is not aging per se that disrupts pm performance, but it is instead primarily the diminished frontal function seen in a subset of older adults.","Morphological studies have found disproportionate volume loss in the prefrontal cortex relative to other regions of the brain (; ; ).

93,"warfarin is often used as a site specific probe for examining the binding of drugs and other solutes to sudlow site i of human serum albumin (hsa). however, warfarin has strong binding to hsa and the two chiral forms of warfarin have slightly different binding affinities for this protein. warfarin also undergoes a slow change in structure when present in common buffers used for binding studies. this report examined the use of four related, achiral compounds (i.e., coumarin, 7 hydroxycoumarin, 7 hydroxy 4 methylcoumarin, and 4 hydroxycoumarin) as possible alternative probes for sudlow site i in drug binding studies. high performance affinity chromatography and immobilized hsa columns were used to compare and evaluate the binding properties of these probe candidates. binding for each of the tested probe candidates to hsa was found to give a good fit to a two site model. the first group of sites had moderate to high affinities for the probe candidates with association equilibrium constants that ranged from 6.4 m1 (coumarin) to 5.5 m1 (4 hydroxycoumarin) at ph 7.4 and 37c. the second group of weaker, and probably non specific, binding regions, had association equilibrium constants that ranged from 3.8 m1 (7 hydroxy 4 methylcoumarin) to 7.3 m1 (coumarin). competition experiments based on zonal elution indicated that all of these probe candidates competed with warfarin at their high affinity regions. warfarin also showed competition with coumarin, 7 hydroxycoumarin and 7 hydroxy 4 methycoumarin for their weak affinity sites but appeared to not bind and or compete for all of the weak sites of 4 hydroxycoumarin. it was found from this group that 4 hydroxycoumarin was the best alternative to warfarin for examining the interactions of drugs at sudlow site i on hsa. these results also provided information on how the major structural components of warfarin contribute to the binding of this drug at sudlow site i.","Another technique that has been popular for some time in this type of application is high performance affinity chromatography (HPAC) .

94,"multidrug resistant proteins (mrp) are members of the atp binding cassette superfamily that facilitate detoxification by transporting toxic compounds, including chemotherapeutic drugs, out of cells. chemotherapy, radiation, and other xenobiotic stresses have been shown to increase levels of select mrps, although, the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. additionally, mrp3 is suspected of playing a role in the drug resistance of non small cell lung carcinoma (nsclc). analysis of the mrp3 promoter revealed the presence of multiple putative electrophile responsive elements (epre), sequences that suggested possible regulation of this gene by nrf2, the key transcription factor that binds to epre. the goal of this investigation was to determine whether mrp3 induction was dependent upon the transcription factor nrf2. keap1, a key regulator of nrf2, sequesters nrf2 in the cytoplasm, preventing entry into the nucleus. the electrophilic lipid peroxidation product, 4 hydroxy 2 nonenal (hne) has been shown to modify keap1 allowing nrf2 to enter the nucleus. we found that hne up regulated mrp3 mrna and protein levels in cell lines with wild type keap1 (human bronchial epithelial cell line hbe1 and the nsclc cell line h358), but not in the keap1 mutant nsclc cell lines (a549 and h460). cell lines with mutant keap1 had constitutively higher mrp3 that was not increased by hne treatment. in hbe1 cells, silencing of nrf2 with sirna inhibited induction of mrp3 and by hne. finally, we found that silencing nrf2 also increased the toxicity of cisplatin in h358 cells. the combined results therefore support the hypothesis that mrp3 induction by hne involves nrf2 activation.","Once bound, Keap1 has been shown to facilitate ubiquitination of Nrf2 and its proteosomal degradation .

96,"cell migration is critically important for the repair of chronic wounds, which cost billions of dollars each year to treat and can lead to serious complications, including amputation and death. growth factors, including epidermal growth factor (egf) and insulin like growth factor (igf 1), are known to be deficient in chronic wounds; unfortunately, traditional delivery of soluble growth factors to wounds is expensive and complicated by their degradation. we have previously shown that directed and accelerated keratinocyte migration could be achieved by creating immobilized gradients of egf. in this work, we have optimized egf gradients for cell migration, synthesized and characterized gradient patterns of igf 1, and tested for migration synergy upon combination of egf and igf 1 patterns. an optimal egf concentration and pattern were identified, resulting in migration that was almost 10 fold that achieved on unpatterned controls. immobilization of igf 1 gradients also accelerated and directed keratinocyte migration (p<0.05), however, no difference in migration was found across various igf 1 concentrations or gradient patterns. although combining egf with igf 1 patterns did not accelerate migration beyond levels achieved using egf alone, these methods can be applied to create other types of multi component gradients that will ultimately be utilized to create 3 d bioactive wound dressings.","Moreover, the possible additive effects of IGF 1+EGF on wound epithelialization make this growth factor combination attractive for incorporation into our existing EGF patterned system.

97,"tumor necrosis factor [tnf] produces a profound anorexia associated with gastrointestinal stasis. our work suggests that the principal site of action of tnf to cause this change in gastric function is via vagal afferents within the nucleus of the solitary tract [nst]. excitation of these afferents presumably causes gastric stasis by activating downstream nst neurons that, in turn, suppress gastric motility via action on neurons in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus that project to the stomach. results from our parallel studies on gastric vago vagal reflexes suggest that noradrenergic neurons in the nst are particularly important to the generation of reflex gastroinhibition. convergence of these observations led us to hypothesize that tnf action in the nst may preferentially affect putative noradrenergic neurons. the current study confirms our observations of a dose dependent tnf activation of cells [as indicated by cfos production] in the nst. the phenotypic identity of these tnf activated neurons in the nst was ~29% tyrosine hydroxylase [th] positive [i.e., presumably noradrenergic neurons]. in contrast, less than 10% of the nitrergic neurons were activated after tnf exposure. surprisingly, another 54% of the cfos activated cells in the nst were phenotypically identified to be astrocytes. taken together with previous observations, the present results suggest that intense or prolonged vagal afferent activity [induced by visceral pathway activity, action of gut hormones or cytokines such as tnf] can alter local astrocyte immediate early gene expression that, in turn, can provoke long term, perhaps permanent changes in the sensitivity of vagal reflex circuitry.","Together, these illness behaviors represent an attempt by the host to marshal its resources during an episode of immune activation.

98,"objective the main objective was to examine the association between simple hysterectomy (without bilateral oophorectomy) and breast cancer risk. because hysterectomy prevalence varies by ethnicity, the secondary objective was to examine whether inclusion of women with hysterectomies affects the estimates of breast cancer risk by ethnicity. methods the multiethnic cohort study was assembled in 1993 6 and included 68,065 women from hawaii and los angeles aged 45 75 years without missing information or bilateral oophorectomy. hysterectomy status was self reported. after 7.7 years median follow up, 1,862 cases of invasive breast cancer were identified. proportional hazards models were used to estimate relative risks (rr) while controlling for known risk factors. results prevalence of simple hysterectomy varied from to 29% among the ethnic groups (white, african american, native hawaiian, japanese american, and latina). overall, hysterectomy was not associated with breast cancer risk (rr=0.98). although the rrs were nonsignificantly elevated by 15% in white women and nonsignificantly reduced by 15% in latinas of non us origin, the variation by ethnicity was not significant (pinteraction=0.48). the breast cancer risk associated with ethnicity was very similar when estimated with and without women with hysterectomies. conclusions this study suggests that simple hysterectomy status does not alter breast cancer risk. therefore, inclusion of women with simple hysterectomies does not substantially change estimated risk of breast cancer by ethnicity.","In 2002, Pike et al. examined the incidence of breast cancer in the MEC and found that a number of ethnic differences in incidence were not explained by known breast cancer risk factors. As compared to White women, Latinas not born in the United States were at nonsignificantly reduced risk of breast cancer, whereas Native Hawaiian women were at significantly increased risk after multivariate adjustment. The crude odds ratio for hysterectomy was estimated also from data presented in a large pooled analysis examining hormone therapy use and breast cancer risk as 0.90 (95% CI=0.87 0.93) .The MEC was designed to investigate lifestyle and dietary factors with respect to cancer outcomes in five different ethnic groups in Hawaii and Los Angeles aged 45 to 75 at baseline; details about the study have been published previously . The study was approved by the institutional review boards at the University of Hawaii and the University of Southern California.

99,"the ser/thr specific phosphatase phlpp (pleckstrin homology domain leucine rich repeat protein phosphatase) regulates the amplitude and duration of agonist evoked akt signaling by dephosphorylating the hydrophobic motif (ser473) of akt, therefore inactivating akt. we recently reported that gene transfer of adenylyl cyclase type (ac6) into neonatal rat cardiac myocytes was associated with increased akt phosphorylation and activity. to determine the underlying mechanisms for ac6 associated increase in akt activation, we determined how ac6 gene transfer regulated the activity of phlpp2 (one of the three phlpp family phosphatases) in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. we found that increased akt activity was associated with inhibition of phlpp2 activity by ac6. ac6 was physically associated with phlpp2, which prevents phlpp2 mediated akt dephosphorylation. however, isoproterenol or forskolin stimulation immediately activated phlpp2, which resulted in markedly dephosphorylation of akt at ser473. activation of phlpp2 by isoproterenol and forskolin was camp independent, but required an intact cytoplasmic domain of ac6. mutation in the cytoplasmic domain of ac6 abolished agonist induced phlpp2 activation. this novel bidirectional regulation of akt activity may contribute to the unexpected favorable effects of ac6 on the failing heart.","However, how endogenous PHLPP is activated remains unknown . The function of PHLPP in cardiac myocytes has not been determined. PHLPP belongs to protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C) family and comprises three isoforms: PHLPP1, PHLPP1 and PHLPP2.Indeed, AC6 and PHLPP2 were co immunoprecipitated by anti AC6 and anti PHLPP2 antibodies, confirming a physical association between these two molecules. PHLPP2 is widely distributed throughout the cell , providing ample opportunity for an AC6: PHLPP2 interaction. Thus, phosphorylation of Ser473 controls the activity of Akt.The present study demonstrates that PHLPP2 activity was suppressed by increased AC6 in cardiac myocytes through their protein protein interaction, which resulted in high levels of Akt phosphorylation. Incubation of NKH477 for 24 hr was also associated with high level of cAMP . Knocking down of PHLPP2 prevented agonist induced PHLPP2 activation.","However, how endogenous PHLPP is activated remains unknown . The function of PHLPP in cardiac myocytes has not been determined.

101,"this paper presents a method for measuring the optical absorption cross sections (a) of au ag nanocages and au nanorods. the method is based on photoacoustic (pa) imaging, where the detected signal is directly proportional to the absorption coefficient (a) of the nanostructure. for each type of nanostructure, we firstly obtained a from the pa signal by benchmarking against a linear calibration curve (pa signal vs. a) derived from a set of methylene blue solutions with different concentrations. we then calculated a by dividing the a by the corresponding concentration of the au nanostructure. additonally, we obtained the extinction cross section (e, sum of absorption and scattering) from the extinction spectrum recorded using a conventional uv vis nir spectrometer. from the measurements of a and e, we were able to easily derive both the absorption and scattering cross sections for each type of gold nanostructure. the ratios of absorption to extinction obtained from experimental and theoretical approaches agreed well, demonstrating the potential use of this method in determining the optical absorption and scattering properties of gold nanostructures and other types of nanomaterials.","This extinction peak is known as the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), which consists of two components: scattering and absorption.

102,"a large body of evidence suggests that the motor system maintains a forward model that predicts the sensory outcome of movements. when sensory feedback does not match the predicted consequences, a compensatory response corrects for the motor error and the forward model is updated to prevent future errors. like other motor behaviours, vocalization relies on sensory feedback for the maintenance of forward models. in this study, we used a frequency altered feedback (faf) paradigm to study the role of auditory feedback in the control of vocal pitch (f0). we adapted subjects to a one semitone shift and induced a perturbation by briefly removing the altered feedback. this was compared to a control block in which a semitone perturbation was introduced into an unshifted trial, or trials were randomly shifted up semitone, and a perturbation was introduced by removing the feedback alteration. the compensation response to mid utterance perturbations was identical in all conditions, and was always smaller than the compensation to a shift at utterance onset. these results are explained by a change in the control strategy at utterance onset and mid utterance. at utterance onset, auditory feedback is compared to feedback predicted by a forward model to ensure the pitch goal is achieved. however, after utterance onset, the control strategy switches and stabilization is maintained by comparing feedback to previous f0 production.","slowly shifted F0 over many trials and observed a compensation response in the direction opposite the shift. Forward models are modified when differences between the predicted outcome of an action and the actual outcome of that action are detected using available feedback mechanisms. These modifications persisted when auditory feedback was removed, demonstrating adaptation occurred within the motor system.A particularly important question to investigate is how much adaptation occurs between trials. It is not clear if this is because our observed adaptation effects represent only a partial remapping of the forward model along with some additional compensation within each utterance, or because of physiological limitations within the system preventing a radical change in initial F0 . That is, the cumulative effect of repeated exposure has not been quantified.In this study, we have shown that the compensation response at utterance onset is larger than the compensation response to a perturbation mid utterance. This finding may have implications for theories of motor control and the universality of motor control mechanisms under different goals and contexts .

103,"summary the biological causes of selective pressures on coding sequence evolution remain controversial, despite the surprising consistency of covariation between common measures of evolutionary change (substitution rates) and gene expression (mrna levels, codon usage) across taxa. we carry out a unified analysis which reveals these conserved patterns in e. coli, yeast, worm, fly, mouse, and human, and suggests that all trends stem largely from a unified underlying selective pressure. in metazoans, these trends are strongest in tissues composed of neurons, whose structure and lifetime confer extreme sensitivity to protein misfolding. we propose, and demonstrate using a molecular level evolutionary simulation, that selection against toxicity of misfolded proteins generated by ribosome errors suffices to create all the observed covariation. the mechanistic model of molecular evolution which emerges yields testable biochemical predictions, calls into question use of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution ratios (ka/ks) to detect functional selection, and suggests how mistranslation may contribute to neurodegenerative disease.","We first carry out a comprehensive, methodologically unified evolutionary analysis across a set of six distantly related model organisms.

It was administered online via an embedded link in e mails sent to all faculty and house officers.The proportions of male and female respondents were not significantly different between the faculty (23 female, 15 male) and house officer groups (27 female, 18 male; p > 0.05). Most faculty (74%) indicated that they probably or definitely plan to stay in academia until they retire .

110,"the traditional sex morbidity mortality paradox that females have worse health but better survival than males is based on studies of major health traits. we applied a cumulative deficits approach to study this paradox, selecting minor health deficits consistently measured in the 9th (1964) and 14th (1974) framingham heart and 5th (19911995) offspring study exams focusing on the age range. we constructed four deficit indices (dis) using all deficits as well as subsets of these deficits characterizing males (dim) and females (dif) health disadvantages, and no relative sex disadvantages. the di34 specific age patterns are sex insensitive within the 55 to 74 age range. the di34, however, tends to selectively increase the risk of death for males. the dif associated health dimension supports the traditional morbidity paradox, whereas the dim associated dimension supports the inverse paradox, wherein males have worse health but better survival than females. the traditional paradox became less pronounced, whereas the inverse paradox became more pronounced from the 1960s to the 1990s. the sex specific excess in minor health deficits may vary according to particular set of deficits, thus providing evidence for traditional and inverse morbidity paradoxes. the time trends suggest the presence of a strong exogenous effect modifier affecting the rate of health deterioration and mortality risk.","These studies basically examined the prevalence of problem oriented symptoms (e.g., symptoms related to headaches ). ii) How do those minor health dimensions affect the mortality risks for each sex?

111,"previous work suggests that control and suffering are related to one another. although it would be expected that within cultures which emphasize the importance of masculinity, as well as personal control, there would be greater suffering among individuals who lose their sense of masculinity or control, how these constructs relate to each other and are individually negotiated has been largely understudied. this paper takes a case study approach to further exploring how the constructs of control, masculinity, and suffering are related in the lived experience of an older european american man, mr. gregor. analysis of this case shows that masculinity is related to control and that these constructs act as themes which interact over mr. gregors lifetime in a variety of ways. the level of control maintained by mr. gregor in different aspects of his life affects his sense of suffering. in some instances his sense of masculinity helps to protect mr. gregor against suffering; in others, it contributes to his suffering. these findings support the notion that there are culturally dependent possibilities for how control and masculinity are related.","Despite the increase in the work done on masculinity theory over the past two decades, the subject of masculinity in later life has not been well studied.

114,"background although mental disorders have been shown to predict subsequent substance disorders, it is unknown if substance disorders could be cost effectively prevented by large scale interventions aimed at prior mental disorders. while experimental intervention is the only way to resolve this uncertainty, a logically prior question is whether the associations of mental disorders with subsequent substance disorders are strong enough to justify mounting such an intervention. we investigate this question here using simulations to estimate the number of substance disorders that might be prevented under several hypothetical intervention scenarios focused on mental disorders. methods data come from the national comorbidity survey replication, a nationally representative us household survey that retrospectively assessed lifetime history and age of onset of dsm iv mental and substance disorders. survival analysis using retrospective age of onset reports was used to estimate associations of mental disorders with subsequent substance dependence. simulations based on the models estimated effect sizes in several hypothetical intervention scenarios. results although successful intervention aimed at mental disorders might prevent some proportion of substance dependence, the number of cases of mental disorder that would have to be treated to prevent a single case of substance dependence is estimated to be so high that this would not be a cost effective way to prevent substance dependence (in the range 76 177 for anxiety mood disorders and 40 47 for externalizing disorders). conclusions treatment of prior mental disorders would not be a cost effective way to prevent substance dependence. however, prevention of substance dependence might be considered an important secondary outcome of interventions for early onset mental disorders.","Randomized controlled trials could be used to answer this question, akin to studies of effects of school based randomized prevention trials for primary prevention of socially maladaptive behavior problems on subsequent drug use (e.g., ; ).

115,"objective cognitive reserve has been proposed as important in the etiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. however, tests of the association between premorbid iq and adult mental disorders other than schizophrenia have been limited and inconclusive. the authors tested the hypothesis that low childhood iq is associated with increased risk and severity of adult mental disorders. method participants were members of a representative 1972 1973 birth cohort of 1,037 males and females in dunedin, new zealand, who were followed up to age with 96% retention. wisc r iq was assessed at ages 7, 9, and 11. research diagnoses of dsm mental disorders were made at ages 18, 21, 26, and 32. results lower childhood iq was associated with increased risk of developing schizophrenia spectrum disorder, adult depression, and adult anxiety. lower childhood iq was also associated with greater comorbidity and with persistence of depression; the association with persistence of generalized anxiety disorder was nearly significant. higher childhood iq predicted increased risk of adult mania. conclusions lower cognitive reserve, as reflected by childhood iq, is an antecedent of several common psychiatric disorders and also predicts persistence and comorbidity. thus, many patients who seek mental health treatment may have lower cognitive ability; this should be considered in prevention and treatment planning.","Among those studies that have examined other disorders, the results have been inconclusive. Studies of bipolar disorder have largely shown no association with premorbid IQ (, , ), but one study of U.S. Army recruits found elevated IQ scores in bipolar patients . If low IQ increases the likelihood of hospitalization, the association between premorbid IQ and psychiatric disorders would be inflated.Fourth, results of the present study are limited to a single, contemporary cohort of New Zealand young adults. First, since persistence was based on a cumulative count of diagnoses, each of which was ascertained in a past year assessment at ages 18, 21, 26, and 32, gaps between our past year assessments may have led us to undercount some cohort members' episodes of disorder. However, with this prospective approach, disorders are not undercounted because of participants' failure to recall criterion symptoms from years past, as occurs in retrospective surveys .Patients with lower cognitive ability could have difficulty accessing services or difficulty understanding and complying with treatment protocols.

Studies of bipolar disorder have largely shown no association with premorbid IQ (, , ), but one study of U.S. Army recruits found elevated IQ scores in bipolar patients . If low IQ increases the likelihood of hospitalization, the association between premorbid IQ and psychiatric disorders would be inflated.Fourth, results of the present study are limited to a single, contemporary cohort of New Zealand young adults. First, since persistence was based on a cumulative count of diagnoses, each of which was ascertained in a past year assessment at ages 18, 21, 26, and 32, gaps between our past year assessments may have led us to undercount some cohort members' episodes of disorder. However, with this prospective approach, disorders are not undercounted because of participants' failure to recall criterion symptoms from years past, as occurs in retrospective surveys .Patients with lower cognitive ability could have difficulty accessing services or difficulty understanding and complying with treatment protocols.

116,"proteases play important roles in a variety of pathologies from heart disease to cancer. quantitative measurement of protease activity is possible using a novel spectrally matched dual fluorophore probe and a small animal lifetime imager. the recorded fluorescence from an activatable fluorophore, one that changes its fluorescent amplitude after biological target interaction, is also influenced by other factors including imaging probe delivery and optical tissue absorption of excitation and emission light. fluorescence from a second spectrally matched constant (non activatable) fluorophore on each nanoparticle platform can be used to correct for both probe delivery and tissue absorption. the fluorescence from each fluorophore is separated using fluorescence lifetime methods.","The probe is small enough to travel throughout the animal and interact with biomolecules. Spectrally matched fluorophores are used to report distribution and activation. The percentage of activation is the ratio of the two signals , since the other terms cancel out due to a common carrier platform .In this case the absorbance terms cancel out exactly .

117,"fluorescence imaging is an important tool for tracking molecular targeting probes in preclinical studies. it offers high sensitivity, but nonetheless low spatial resolution compared to other leading imaging methods such ct and mri. we demonstrate our methodological development in small animal in vivo whole body imaging using fluorescence tomography. we have implemented a noncontact fluid free fluorescence diffuse optical tomography system that uses a raster scanned continuous wave diode laser as the light source and an intensified ccd camera as the photodetector. the specimen is positioned on a motorized rotation stage. laser scanning, data acquisition, and stage rotation are controlled via labview applications. the forward problem in the heterogeneous medium is based on a normalized born method, and the sensitivity function is determined using a monte carlo method. the inverse problem (image reconstruction) is performed using a regularized iterative algorithm, in which the cost function is defined as a weighted sum of the l 2 norms of the solution image, the residual error, and the image gradient. the relative weights are adjusted by two independent regularization parameters. our initial tests of this imaging system were performed with an imaging phantom that consists of a translucent plastic cylinder filled with tissue simulating liquid and two thin wall glass tubes containing indocyanine green. the reconstruction is compared to the output of a finite element method based software package nirfast and has produced promising results.","Fluorescence tomography is a rapidly expanding field of study in which traditional planar fluorescence imagery is being fused with many other modern technologies, among which target specific probes and tomographical reconstruction methods are the most notable ones. This is particularly important for small animal imaging because otherwise the modeling error can be disproportionately large. If the optical properties of an initial baseline condition are known, and if the deviation from this baseline is sufficiently small, gradient driven perturbation approaches can be used to solve the diffusion equation.This is achieved by comparing each pair of images taken at the opposite angles and finding a displacement so that they become closest mirror images to each other in terms of the smallest root mean square (RMS) difference. These images are segmented using thresholding and converted into a set of binary images. The relation between a 3 D volume and its 2 D projections is well modeled by Radon transform .However, the reconstructed structures in appear to be slightly tilted and closer to each other than their actual locations. The intensity of the reconstructed images was normalized to their maximum values for comparison. show the gray scale and segmented images of the reconstruction, respectively, using our Monte Carlo simulation based method.","Fluorescence tomography is a rapidly expanding field of study in which traditional planar fluorescence imagery is being fused with many other modern technologies, among which target specific probes and tomographical reconstruction methods are the most notable ones.

120,"cells store excess energy in the form of cytoplasmic lipid droplets. at present, it is unclear how different types of fatty acids contribute to the formation of lipid droplets. we describe a compound raman microscope capable of both high speed chemical imaging and quantitative spectral analysis on the same platform. we use a picosecond laser source to perform coherent raman scattering imaging of a biological sample and confocal raman spectral analysis at points of interest. the potential of the compound raman microscope is evaluated on lipid bodies of cultured cells and live animals. our data indicate that the in vivo fat contains much more unsaturated fatty acids (fas) than the fat formed via de novo synthesis in 3t3 l1 cells. furthermore, in vivo analysis of subcutaneous adipocytes and glands revealed a drastic difference not only in the unsaturation level but also in the thermodynamic state of fas inside their lipid bodies. additionally, the compound raman microscope allows tracking the cellular uptake of a specific fatty acid and its abundance in nascent cytoplasmic lipid droplets. the high speed vibrational imaging and spectral analysis capability renders compound raman microscopy an indispensible analytical tool to the studies of lipid droplet biology.","Such acquisition speed precludes its application to analysis of highly dynamic features such as live cells .

121,"to determine the degree to which intramuscular pressure (imp) and muscle force are correlated in an intact compartment, a custom pressure transducer was inserted into the rabbit tibialis anterior (ta) while activating the muscle via the peroneal nerve and measuring ta muscle force distal to the ankle retinaculum. in general, imp was more variable compared to muscle force throughout the entire isometric length tension relationship. in contrast to results obtained on isolated ta muscles, imp force relations with the compartment intact were not significantly different between the ascending and descending limbs of the length tension curve. specifically, average relative pressure force coefficients of determination (r2) were 0.760.11 for the active ascending limb and 0.980.01 for the active descending limb. these data demonstrate that muscle force and imp are fairly well correlated under isometric conditions and that this relationship is not improved by measuring imp in an intact environment.","The most promising approach for obtaining such unambiguous information (absent modeling assumptions) is direct measurement of intramuscular pressure (IMP) during voluntary movement. In that study, it was found that muscle force and IMP were reasonably correlated but that the IMP measurements were much more variable than force measurements with coefficients of variations approaching 100%. Functional evaluation of human muscle may range in scale from the highly invasive direct measurement of active, or passive muscle force to noninvasive or minimally invasive inference of function based on the electromyogram (EMG,) or a muscle image (Ultrasound, and MRI,).The length tension protocol consisted of a series of 100 Hz tetanic contractions (pulse width 0.3 ms; amplitude 10 V) over a 640 ms period. Two minute rest intervals were interposed between contractions to minimize fatigue effects. Likewise, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was employed to quantify absolute agreement between the data sets.The raw intramuscular pressure time traces mimicked the general shape of the raw isometric force time traces but exhibited a drop in pressure over the course of activation as previously reported.

For most subjects, if one increases the size of the imaging beam by over 2 mm at the eye's pupil, lateral resolution deteriorates . What makes OCT so attractive is its high sensitivity (ability to measure weak backscattered signals), high acquisition speed (allowing volumetric imaging within seconds) and high axial resolution tomographic cross sections.Its size, however, is still small compared to the FOV of standard clinical instruments. This permits 3.5 m axial resolution in retinal tissue. As already mentioned, such volumetric sampling is not dense enough to reveal volumetric cellular structures.We currently choose the maximum value of two overlaying voxels as the value of the resulting voxel in order to preserve the prominent characteristics of each volume.

126,"familial clustering of autoimmune disease is well recognised and raises the possibility that some susceptibility genes may predispose to autoimmunity in general. in light of this observation it might be expected that some of the variants of established relevance in one autoimmune disease may also be relevant in other related conditions. based on this hypothesis we tested seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) that are known to be associated with type diabetes in a large multiple sclerosis dataset consisting of 2,369 trio families, 5,737 cases and 10,296 unrelated controls. two of these seven snps demonstrated evidence for association with multiple sclerosis; rs12708716 from the clec16a gene (p=1.61016) and rs763361 from the cd226 gene (p=5.4108). these findings thereby identify two additional multiple sclerosis susceptibility genes and lend support to the notion of autoimmune susceptibility genes.","Under this hypothesis the loci associated with one autoimmune disorder are reasonable candidates for other autoimmune disorders. These SNPs were typed in a large multiple sclerosis dataset consisting of 2,369 trio families, 5,737 cases and 10,296 unrelated controls.

130,"the majority of anuran amphibians (frogs and toads) use acoustic communication to mediate sexual behavior and reproduction. generally, females find and select their mates using acoustic cues provided by males in the form of conspicuous advertisement calls. in these species, vocal signal production and reception are intimately tied to successful reproduction. research with anurans has demonstrated that acoustic communication is modulated by reproductive hormones, including gonadal steroids and peptide neuromodulators. most of these studies have focused on the ways in which hormonal systems influence vocal signal production; however, here we will concentrate on a growing body of literature that examines hormonal modulation of call reception. this literature suggests that reproductive hormones contribute to the coordination of reproductive behaviors between signaler and receiver by modulating sensitivity and spectral filtering of the anuran auditory system. it has become evident that the hormonal systems that influence reproductive behaviors are highly conserved among vertebrate taxa, thus studying the endocrine and neuromodulatory bases of acoustic communication in frogs and toads can lead to insights of broader applicability to hormonal modulation of vertebrate sensory physiology and behavior.","In the vast majority of anurans, vocal signaling mediates sexual behavior: sexually active males produce courtship calls to attract females. Research in amphibians has also revealed that many of the hormones that modulate vocal communication are the same as those found in other vertebrate taxa, indicating that hormonal mechanisms influencing reproductive behaviors are evolutionarily conserved. In anurans, seasonal changes in hormone levels correlate with seasonal changes in calling behavior (; ; ; ; ; ).A subsequent study demonstrated that female tngara frogs injected with estradiol show a similar likelihood of phonotaxis, and similar call preferences, as non manipulated females in breeding condition. The peptide is released into general circulation by neurosecretory cells in the preoptic area (POA) or, in mammals, in the anterior hypothalamic nuclei. Below, we will give a brief summary of the primary features of these two systems .Hormones play a vital role in regulating the sexual behavior of vertebrates, from frogs to humans, and hormonal systems are highly conserved across vertebrate taxa. Acoustic communication is the primary mediator of sexual behavior in the majority of anuran species, thus it provides an excellent system within which to explore the diversity of ways in which hormones work to ensure appropriate and successful reproductive activity. To coordinate breeding, both signalers and receivers are under selection to produce appropriate and temporally coordinated behaviors during the reproductive season.","In the vast majority of anurans, vocal signaling mediates sexual behavior: sexually active males produce courtship calls to attract females.

Our analysis cannot address whether reductions in mortality are associated with the differential characteristics of the population. Indeed, the proportion of ALE out of TLE is slightly lower (though not statistically significant) in 2002 compared to 1992 without adjustments for SES, healthcare resources, and chronic diseases .Such findings may reflect medical and technical advances in the treatments, devices, and accommodations for persons to help them achieve better functioning in their environments . However, more research is needed to validate this argument .

134,"aims sexual assault in the military (saim) is associated with decreased sexual satisfaction. however, mediators of this association have not been fully described. using a retrospective analysis of cross sectional data collected for the national veterans affairs (va) womens health survey, we propose a mediator model to explain the association between saim and decreased sexual satisfaction among women veterans. four mediators of the association between saim and decreased sexual satisfaction are tested: (1) emotional health related quality of life, (2) physical health related quality of life, (3) lack of a close partner and (4) gynecological illness. these mediators were chosen to encompass independent domains potentially relevant to sexual satisfaction, including emotional, physical, and relational. results of women (87%) who answered the sexual satisfaction question, the mean age was (sd 15) years; 85% were white. twenty four percent reported a history of saim and 39% reported sexual dissatisfaction. in age adjusted logistic regresion analyses, both saim and sexual dissatisfaction were strongly associated with each of the proposed mediators. however, of the four mediators, emotional health related quality of life most strongly attenuated the association between saim and sexual dissatsifaction. after including all mediators, the association between saim and decreased sexual satisfaction was markedly attenuated. conclusions saim's negative impact on sexual satisfaction in women veterans operates both directly and through its physical and mental health sequelae. of the proposed mediators in this association, the most prominent is mental health related quality of life; the other proposed mediators were minimally related.","More than half of the women who report a history of SAIM were not satisfied with their sex life, compared to 34% of women who did not report a history of SAIM. Sexual satisfaction is defined as an affective response arising from ones subjective evaluation of the positive and negative dimensions associated with ones sexual relationship, but may incorporate both partnered sexual activity and self stimulation. Thus, trauma may mediate decreased sexual satisfaction through its effect on the relational domain of sexual satisfaction .In nested modeling, each successive model includes significant or prespecified predictors from the previous model, and adds potential predictors from the next domain. All statistical analyses were run using SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary NC) . If a potential mediator was either not statistically significantly associated or did not alter the effect estimate of SAIM on sexual satisfaction by at least 10% or more, it was inconsistent with our model.Women veterans are exposed at high rates to sexual trauma, which adversely impacts sexual satisfaction, an important aspect of health related quality of life. Self reported sexual assault while in the military (SAIM) was measured by an affirmative response to the question, Did you ever have an experience where someone used force or the threat of force to have sexual relations with you against your will while you were in the military? As the population of women veterans increases in both the VA and the community, the burden of SAIM may become more evident.","More than half of the women who report a history of SAIM were not satisfied with their sex life, compared to 34% of women who did not report a history of SAIM.

135,"background recent trial data have challenged the hypothesis that cholesteryl ester transfer protein (cetp) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (hdlc) have causal roles in atherothrombosis. one method to evaluate this issue is to examine whether polymorphisms in the cetp gene that impact on hdlc levels also impact on the future development of myocardial infarction. methods and results in a prospective cohort of 18,245 initially healthy american women, we examined over 350,000 singe nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) first to identify loci associated with hdlc and then to evaluate whether significant snps within these loci also impact upon rates of incident myocardial infarction during an average 10 year follow up period. nine loci on chromosomes had one or more snps associated with hdlc at genomewide statistical significance (p<5108). however, only snps near or in the cetp gene at 16q13 were associated with both hdlc and risk of incident myocardial infarction (198 events). for example, snp rs708272 in the cetp gene was associated with a per allele increase in hdlc levels of 3.1 mg/dl and a concordant percent lower risk of future myocardial infarction (age adjusted hr 0.76, 95%ci 0.620.94), consistent with recent meta analysis. independent and again concordant effects on hdlc and incident myocardial infarction were also observed at the cetp locus for rs4329913 and rs7202364. adjustment for hdlc attenuated did not eliminate these effects. conclusion in this prospective cohort of initially healthy women, snps at the cetp locus impact upon future risk of myocardial infarction, supporting a causal role for cetp in atherothrombosis, possibly through an hdlc mediated pathway.","Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) promotes the transfer of cholesteryl esters from high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) to other lipoprotein particles, and individuals genetically deficient for CETP often have extremely high HDLC levels, .

137,"background many school age children with specific language impairment (sli)produce sentences that appear to conform to the adult grammar. it may be premature to conclude from this, however, that their language formulation ability is age appropriate. aims in this study, we sought to determine whether a more subtle measure of language use, speech disruptions during sentence formulation, might serve to distinguish children with sli from their typically developing (td) peers at an age when grammatical accuracy was high. we analyzed the rate of speech disruptions in simple sentence production in school age children with sli and td age matched peers. we predicted that (1) the sli group would exhibit more speech disruptions than the td group as a result of reduced language proficiency even when grammatical accuracy was high and, (2) the sli group would demonstrate greater reductions in disruption frequency as compared to the td group when given sentences that model the target syntactic structures. methods & procedures twenty eight children (17 sli, td, m = 8;10 years) with no history of stuttering were presented with a series of picture pairs. the examiner described the first picture using a simple sentence and asked the child to repeat the sentence; the child then described the second picture. there were two priming conditions: matching syntax condition (paired pictures requiring the same syntactic structure) and different syntax condition (paired pictures requiring different syntactic structures). all testing was audio recorded and speech disruptions (repetitions, revisions, fillers, long silent pauses) were transcribed and tabulated for each target response. the data were analyzed in an analysis of variance (anova). outcomes & results t he sli group demonstrated a significantly greater number of speech disruptions when compared to the td group. there was no effect for priming. conclusions & implications school age children with sli appear to have difficulty with sentence formulation when compared to td peers even when grammatical accuracy is high. we concluded that school age children with sli may demonstrate subtle but persistent language formulation difficulties.","Much attention has been paid to language production errors in the speech of children with SLI. As a result, the children with SLI may lag behind their peers in the progression from accuracy to automaticity and therefore be less proficient in their language formulation abilities.

The picture pairs were pseudo randomized such that no main verb (e.g., washing, reading) was used for two consecutive items . Speech disruptions contained within revisions were not counted in order to avoid double counting disruptions; in such instances only the revision was counted.We examined the incidence of speech disruptions in the simple sentence production of children with SLI as compared to their TD peers. Furthermore, these difficulties may not be detected by measures that distinguish younger children with SLI from their TD peers, such as grammatical accuracy.

144,"during breast cancer progression, a substantial increase in chromosomal aberrations is observed in the transition from ductal hyperplasia to carcinoma in situ (dcis). telomeres are essential structures to chromosomal integrity. consequently, telomere dysfunction, which leads to genomic instability, is hypothesized to play a causal role in the progression of breast cancer. however, the few epidemiologic studies that have assessed the relationship between telomere length and breast cancer risk have been inconsistent. we used quantitative real time pcr to measure relative telomere length in genomic dna extracted from peripheral blood leukocyles and examined its association with postmenopausal breast cancer risk in invasive breast cancer cases and matched controls free of diagnosed cancer nested within the prospective nurses health study. our data show that relative telomere length was not associated with a significant elevation in postmenopausal breast cancer risk (below vs. above median; or = 1.23, 95% ci = 0.941.60, ptrend = 0.20). estrone and estradiol hormone levels were significantly inversely associated with relative telomere length (p = 0.02). other established breast cancer risk factors such as family history of breast cancer and history of benign breast disease were not associated with relative telomere length in separate linear regression models each adjusted for age and disease status (p 0.07). our results provide little support for an important role of telomere length, as measured in peripheral blood leukocyles, as a biomarker of breast cancer risk.","Reactivation of telomerase is detected in >90% of human tumors, making it one of the most common abnormalities in cancer cells .

149,"this study reports on the ability of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (pegda) hydrogel scaffolds with pendant integrin binding grgdsp peptides (rgd gels) to support the re differentiation of cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (smcs) toward a contractile phenotype. human coronary smcs were seeded on rgd gels, hydrogels with other extracellular matrix derived peptides, fibronectin (fn) and laminin (ln). differentiation was induced on rgd gels with low serum medium containing soluble heparin, and the differentiation status was monitored by mrna expression, protein expression, and intracellular protein organization of the contractile smooth muscle markers, smooth muscle actin, calponin and sm 22. rgd gels supported a rapid induction (2.7 to 25 fold up regulation) of smc marker gene mrna, with expression levels that were equivalent to fn and ln controls. marker protein levels mirrored the changes in mrna expression, with levels on rgd gels indistinguishable from fn and ln controls. furthermore, these markers co localized in stress fibers within smcs on rgd gels suggesting the recapitulation of a contractile apparatus within the cells. these results indicate that smcs cultured on rgd bearing hydrogels can re differentiate toward a contractile phenotype suggesting this material is an excellent candidate for further development as a bioactive scaffold that regulates smc phenotype.","These synthetic SMCs are implicated in the stenosis of the vascular reconstruction. In this report, our goal was to assess the ability of RGD bearing PEGDA hydrogels (RGD gels) to support an in vitro transition of cultured human vascular SMCs toward a contractile phenotype . PEGDA hydrogels resist the adsorption of exogenous proteins and non specific cell attachment.Samples were suspended in sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS PAGE) sample buffer (final composition: 62.5 mM Tris [pH 6.8], 2% w/v SDS, 10% v/v glycerol, 5% v/v mercaptoethanol, 25 g/ml bromophenol blue). Protein samples (5 g per lane) were separated on a Tris HCl Ready Gel (12% resolving, 4% stacking, Bio rad) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The blot was visualized using horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibodies (goat anti mouse: 80 ng/ml, goat anti rabbit: 100 ng/ml, Santa Cruz) and the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent detection system (Pierce) using CL XPosure film (Pierce).We screened a variety of peptides derived from ECM proteins including those known to modulate SMC phenotype: KQAGDV (fibrinogen) [, ], GKDGEA (type I collagen) , YIGSR (laminin) , and VAPG (elastin) . Since the population of SMCs that would likely populate a regeneration inducing TEBV in vivo would also adopt a synthetic phenotype (in order to migrate and proliferate in the scaffold), scaffold cell interactions might be best designed to accommodate a synthetic to contractile switch, rather than inhibit de differentiation to the synthetic phenotype. This molecule is not only a marker of cell phenotype, but a critical component of the contractile machinery.","These synthetic SMCs are implicated in the stenosis of the vascular reconstruction.

150,"a frequent chromosomal translocation in mature b cell non hodgkin lymphoma affects band 3q27 and results in deregulation of the b cell lymphoma (bcl6) gene. two breakpoint clusters have been described thus far, the major breakpoint region (mbr) and an alternative breakpoint region (abr) that is located kb 5' to bcl6. translocation at the mbr predominates in diffuse large b cell lymphoma, whereas translocation at the abr is reported to be frequently associated with grade 3b follicular lymphoma. however, translocation at the abr has not been studied in a large series of follicular lymphomas, particularly t(14;18) negative follicular lymphomas. therefore, we studied blc6 rearrangements at the mbr and abr by using break apart fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) probes in cases of follicular lymphomas, including t(14;18) negative and t(14;18) positive cases. conventional cytogenetic (karyotype) analysis was also performed in of the t(14;18) negative cases. bcl6 rearrangement was found in 26% of t(14;18) negative and 19% of t(14;18) positive follicular lymphoma. t(14;18) negative cases showed a high frequency of rearrangement at the abr (12%) with an abr:mbr ratio of 0.86, compared to only 5% with an abr:mbr ratio of 0.36 in the t(14;18) positive cases. bcl6 rearrangements were found in all grades of follicular lymphoma but were most frequent in grade t(14;18) negative follicular lymphoma (60%). fish analysis had a higher sensitivity for detecting bcl6 rearrangements than conventional cytogenetics. in conclusion, bcl6 rearrangements occur at a similar frequency in t(14;18) negative follicular lymphoma and diffuse large b cell lymphoma. however, t(14;18) negative follicular lymphoma appears to have a higher frequency of rearrangement at the abr compared with t(14;18) positive follicular lymphoma and diffuse large b cell lymphoma. therefore, it is important to perform fish analysis with abr to determine possible involvement of bcl6 rearrangement in follicular lymphoma, especially in t(14;18) negative cases.","This translocation can be identified in 85 90% of nodal follicular lymphoma cases. We also compared these results with our previously published study of diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Additional genetic alterations result in progression to follicular lymphoma.To analyze the hybridization, a total of 50 100 nuclei per case were scored for the presence of the BCL6 rearrangement. A BCL6 break apart probe (Abbott Vysis, Downers Grove, IL, USA) was used to detect BCL6 rearrangement at the MBR, and a home brew break apart probe (Clones RP11 1144D2 and RP11 76L15, kindly provided by W. L. Lam and R. J. deLeeuw) was used for rearrangement at the ABR . A cutoff for positive FISH assays for both the MBR and ABR was established to be more than 20%.Twenty eight of the 49 cases were grade 3A and half of the 28 cases were grade 3A with a diffuse large B cell component.

152,"past mining activities in northern mexico left a legacy of delerict landscapes devoid of vegetation and seasonal formation of salt efflorescence. metal content was measured in mine tailings, efflorescent salts, soils, road dust and residential soils to investigate contamination. climatic effects such as heavy wind and rainfall events can have great impact on the dispersion of metals in semi arid areas, since soils are typically sparsely vegetated. geochemical analysis of this site revealed that even though total metal content in mine tailings was relatively low (e.g. cu = mg kg 1), metals including mn, ba, zn, and cu were all found at significantly higher levels in efflorescence salts formed by evaporation on the tailings impoundment surface following the rainy season (e.g. cu=68000 mg kg 1). such efflorescent fine grained salts are susceptible to wind erosion resulting in increased metal spread to nearby residential soils. our results highlight the importance of seasonally dependent salt formation and wind erosion in determining risk levels associated with potential inhalation or ingestion of airborne particulates originating from contaminated sites such as tailings impoundments. in low metal content mine tailings located in arid and semi arid environments, efflorescence salts could represent a human health risk and a challenge for plant establishment in mine tailings.","Wind erosion is also important in determining risks levels associated with potential inhalation of airborne particulates from contaminated soils . Firstly, young children are more likely to ingest non food objects and repetitive hand/finger sucking. Secondly, children have a much higher absorption rate of heavy metals from digestion system and higher hemoglobin sensitivity to metals than adults .Strong evapotranspiration occurs during the hottest months of the year along with major precipitation. In this case, sorption processes would strongly limit the upward mobility of the bivalent metal cations . Stratification, layers of different thickness, desiccation cracks, and efflorescence salts are commonly observed in this side of the tailings.Measurements of air concentrations are suggested as future work in order to quantify the influence of efflorescence salts in air quality . Background samples were collected from six non contaminated sites outside the urban area (S1 S6). An enrichment factor (EF) can be used to differentiate between the metals originating from human activities and those from natural provenance, to help assess the degree of anthropogenic influence.","Wind erosion is also important in determining risks levels associated with potential inhalation of airborne particulates from contaminated soils .

154,"data management software applications specifically designed for the clinical research environment are increasingly available from commercial vendors and open source communities, however, general purpose spreadsheets remain widely employed in clinical research data management (crdm). spreadsheet suitability for this use is controversial, and no formal comparative usability evaluations have been performed. we report on an application of the ufurt (user, function, representation, and task (analyses)) methodology to create a domain specific process for usability evaluation. we demonstrate this process in an evaluation of differences in usability between a spreadsheet program (microsoft excel) and a commercially available clinical research data management system (cdms) (phase forward clintrial). through this domain specific operationalization of ufurt methodology, we successfully identified usability differences and quantified task and cost differences, while delineating these from socio technical aspects. ufurt can similarly be generalized to other domains.","In order to identify and clarify differences, we need a method for comparing competing products for a particular research setting.

155,"the well accepted biopsychosocial model proposes that the experience of pain and responses to it result from a complex interaction of biological, psychological, and social factors. however, the separation of these constructs is substantially artificial, and we presume that psychological processes have biological effects, that biological processes affect an individuals psychosocial environment, and so on. considerable research has demonstrated that pain coping strategies influence perceived pain intensity and physical functioning, and individual differences in styles of pain coping even shape the persistence of long term pain complaints in some populations. a good deal of this coping research has focused on catastrophizing, which is a generally maladaptive cognitive and emotional mental set that involves feelings of helplessness when in pain, rumination about pain symptoms, and magnification of pain related complaints. collectively, catastrophizing has been consistently associated with heightened experiences of pain across a variety of samples. although catastrophic thinking regarding pain related symptoms is often classified under the psychologic category within the broader biopsychosocial model, we propose that catastrophizing exerts biologic effects that may account for some of its negative consequences. in general, the cognitive and affective processes captured within the construct of catastrophizing may exert effects on the neuromuscular, cardiovascular, immune, and neuroendocrine systems, and on the activity in the pain neuromatrix within the brain. the interface between pain related neurobiology and processes such as pain related catastrophizing represents an important avenue for future pain research.","The biopsychosocial model of pain has now almost universally replaced the traditional biomedical characterizations of pain that focused on disease and injury related activation of specific receptors in the peripheral nervous system that directly transmitted pain related information to the brain. These disease models of the pain experience assumed a tight correspondence between pain and pathology; this concept has been over turned by a great deal of research on chronic pain syndromes such as fibromyalgia, lower back pain, and osteoarthritis. The pace of chronic pain research seems to have quickened over the last several decades, which includes the present Decade of Pain Control and Research, perhaps as a consequence of increasing awareness regarding the enormous public health costs and challenges associated with chronic pain conditions.Mindbody interactions in pain: the neurophysiology of anxious and catastrophic pain related thoughts 19218091 Some other studies have provided evidence that catastrophizing may exert a broad influence on physiologic responses to pain, and that its influence may extend across multiple systems. For example, in several studies of healthy young adults, catastrophizing predicted increased systolic blood pressure reactivity to pain and enhanced myocardial contractility for a prolonged period of time following a cold pressor task. Relatedly, catastrophizing seems to influence the relationship among muscle tension, cardiovascular stress, and pain response; electromyography suggests that under specific conditions, catastrophizing is positively related to indices of lumbar paraspinal muscle responses.Taken together, this literature provides demonstrative evidence for complex neuroendocrine, neuroimmune, psychophysiologic, and functional neuroanatomic effects of catastrophizing on the pain experience. Such studies will help to establish the neurophysiologic implications of catastrophizing in a more causal fashion. Similarly, a study of intravenous pentazocine in healthy adults revealed that increased indices of catastrophizing were associated with less subsequent analgesic benefit of pentazocine, especially among men.","The biopsychosocial model of pain has now almost universally replaced the traditional biomedical characterizations of pain that focused on disease and injury related activation of specific receptors in the peripheral nervous system that directly transmitted pain related information to the brain.

The pace of chronic pain research seems to have quickened over the last several decades, which includes the present Decade of Pain Control and Research, perhaps as a consequence of increasing awareness regarding the enormous public health costs and challenges associated with chronic pain conditions.Mindbody interactions in pain: the neurophysiology of anxious and catastrophic pain related thoughts 19218091 Some other studies have provided evidence that catastrophizing may exert a broad influence on physiologic responses to pain, and that its influence may extend across multiple systems. For example, in several studies of healthy young adults, catastrophizing predicted increased systolic blood pressure reactivity to pain and enhanced myocardial contractility for a prolonged period of time following a cold pressor task. Relatedly, catastrophizing seems to influence the relationship among muscle tension, cardiovascular stress, and pain response; electromyography suggests that under specific conditions, catastrophizing is positively related to indices of lumbar paraspinal muscle responses.Taken together, this literature provides demonstrative evidence for complex neuroendocrine, neuroimmune, psychophysiologic, and functional neuroanatomic effects of catastrophizing on the pain experience. Such studies will help to establish the neurophysiologic implications of catastrophizing in a more causal fashion. Similarly, a study of intravenous pentazocine in healthy adults revealed that increased indices of catastrophizing were associated with less subsequent analgesic benefit of pentazocine, especially among men.",0.46992481203007525,0.09056603773584906,0.26094362108722474,0.46992481203007525,0.09056603773584906,0.26094362108722474
156,"type diabetes is an autoimmune disorder characterized by progressive destruction of insulin secreting cells of the pancreas, in which cd8+ t cells play a critical role. the diversity in the hla alleles expressed among various racial and ethnic groups leads to great variability in antigen presentation and recognition by cd8+ t cells in the context of mhc class i molecules. to date, studies aimed at identifying disease relevant antigenic epitopes have focused on using mice transgenic for hla a*0201, a common allele, particularly among caucasians. we present hla class i typing data from type diabetic children at the childrens hospital at montefiore, where the patient population is ethnically diverse but largely minority. when categorized into the hla supertypes a2, a3, b7, and c1, 77% of those studied belong to at least supertype, and of these, 65% do not belong to the a2 supertype, which is the supertype represented by the hla a*0201 allele. these results support the need for studies using hla transgenic mice expressing mhc molecules representative of a variety of hla supertypes, particularly when searching for antigenic epitopes applicable for study among largely urban, minority pediatric populations.","Therefore, knowledge of the HLA types of various populations is key in tailoring appropriate investigational and therapeutic trials. Given the various limitations encountered in direct human investigations, HLA transgenic NOD mice expressing human class I MHC molecules serve as excellent animal models for study. However, HLA class I alleles are tremendously diverse, with 489 HLA A, 830 HLA B, and 266 HLA C alleles identified to date.Blood samples from 88 children with type 1 diabetes treated at the Children's Hospital at Montefiore were collected. Due to the use of primarily low resolution typing, certain alleles had multiple potential identities. The identified alleles were then grouped as appropriate into the three well characterized HLA A or B supertypes A2, A3, and B7, or the HLA C supertype C1.We identified 22 different HLA A alleles, 45 different HLA B alleles, and 17 different HLA C alleles in our group of 88 children with type 1 diabetes. Although HLA A*0201 was one of the most common alleles identified, only 16 of the 88 patients (18%) were positive for this allele. Seventy seven percent of patients (68) belonged to at least 1 supertype, and 32% belonged to at least 2 supertypes.","Therefore, knowledge of the HLA types of various populations is key in tailoring appropriate investigational and therapeutic trials.

157,"background there is an intense interest in the possibility that neighborhood characteristics influence active transportation such as walking or biking. the purpose of this paper is to illustrate how a spatial cluster identification method can evaluate the geographic variation of active transportation and identify neighborhoods with unusually high/low levels of active transportation. methods self reported walking/biking prevalence, demographic characteristics, street connectivity variables, and neighborhood socioeconomic data were collected from respondents to the california health interview survey (chis; n=10,688) in los angeles county (lac) and san diego county (sdc). spatial scan statistics were used to identify clusters of high or low prevalence (with and without age adjustment) and the quantity of time spent walking and biking. the data, a subset from the chis, were analyzed in 20072008. results geographic clusters of significantly high or low prevalence of walking and biking were detected in lac and sdc. structural variables such as street connectivity and shorter block lengths are consistently associated with higher levels of active transportation, but associations between active transportation and socioeconomic variables at the individual and neighborhood levels are mixed. only one cluster with less time spent walking and biking among walkers/bikers was detected in lac, and this was of borderline significance. age adjustment affects the clustering pattern of walking/biking prevalence in lac, but not in sdc. conclusions the use of spatial scan statistics to identify significant clustering of health behaviors such as active transportation adds to the more traditional regression analysis that examines associations between behavior and environmental factors by identifying specific geographic areas with unusual levels of the behavior independent of predefined administrative units.","Nonetheless, it seems possible that such approaches are limited by the ability of simple models to describe the effects of multiple contextual and environmental influences, particularly if these influences vary geographically. This interest is due in part to the current epidemic of obesity and in part to continued interest in building healthy communities. Notably, SaTScan has also been extended to identify elliptical as well as circular clusters of disease cases, grade and stage of cancer diagnosis, and survival rates.None The associations between walking/biking and other individual characteristics generally varied among the clusters. Most of these street connectivity differences were highly significant .The clusters of high walking prevalence identified in LAC include two communities on the ocean (Long Beach and Santa Monica) and three communities in the downtown and central regions of the city. The identification of disease clusters has been a prominent tool for health researchers at least since Snows analysis of cholera. For example, transportation walking appears to be influenced by age, gender, auto ownership, and SES,, as well as diverse environmental variables.","Nonetheless, it seems possible that such approaches are limited by the ability of simple models to describe the effects of multiple contextual and environmental influences, particularly if these influences vary geographically.

159,"magnetic resonance imaging (mri) and mr spectroscopy can probe a variety of physiological (e.g. blood vessel permeability) and metabolic characteristics of prostate cancer. however, little is known about the changes in gene expression that underlie the spectral and imaging features observed in prostate cancer. tumor induced changes in vascular permeability and angiogenesis are thought to contribute to patterns of dynamic contrast enhanced (dce) mri images of prostate cancer even though the genetic basis of tumor vasculogenesis is complex and the specific mechanisms underlying these dcemri features have not yet been determined. in order to identify the changes in gene expression that correspond to mrs and dcemri patterns in human prostate cancers, we have utilized tissue print micropeel techniques to generate whole mount molecular maps of radical prostatectomy specimens that correspond to pre surgical mri/mrs studies. these molecular maps include rna expression profiles from both affymetrix genechip microarrays and quantitative reverse transcriptase pcr (qrt pcr) analysis, as well as immunohistochemical studies. using these methods on patients with prostate cancer, we found robust over expression of choline kinase a in the majority of primary tumors. we also observed overexpression of neuropeptide y (npy), a newly identified angiogenic factor, in a subset of dcemri positive prostate cancers. these studies set the stage for establishing mri/mrs parameters as validated biomarkers for human prostate cancer.","Of all of the modalities available, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) holds the most promise for providing both high resolution anatomical images , functional [, ], and metabolic images of prostate cancer [, ].

164,"siglecs (sialic acid binding, immunoglobulin [ig] like lectins) are a family of single pass transmembrane cell surface proteins found predominantly on leukocytes. their unique structural characteristics include an n terminal carbohydrate binding (lectin) domain that binds sialic acid, followed by a variable number of ig like domains, hence these structures are a subset of the ig gene superfamily. another unique feature of siglecs is that most, but not all, possess so called immunoreceptor tyrosine based inhibitory motifs (itims) in their cytoplasmic domains, suggesting that these molecules function in an inhibitory capacity. siglec 8, the eighth member identified at the time, was discovered as part of an effort initiated almost a decade ago to identify novel human eosinophil and mast cell proteins. since that time, its selective expression on human eosinophils and mast cells has been confirmed. on eosinophils, siglec 8 engagement results in apoptosis, whereas on mast cells, inhibition of fcri dependent mediator release, without apoptosis, is seen. it has subsequently been determined that the closest functional paralog in the mouse is siglec f, selectively expressed by eosinophils but not expressed on mast cells. despite only modest homology, both siglec 8 and siglec f preferentially recognize a sulfated glycan ligand closely related to sialyl lewis x, a common ligand for the selectin family of adhesion molecules. murine experiments in normal, siglec f deficient mice and hypereosinophilic mice have resulted in similar conclusions that siglec f, like siglec 8, plays a distinctive and important role in regulating eosinophil accumulation and survival in vivo. given the resurgent interest in eosinophil directed therapies for a variety of disorders, plus its unique additional ability to also target the mast cell, therapies focusing on siglec 8 could some day prove to be a useful adjunct to our current armamentarium for the treatment of asthma, allergies and related disorders where overproduction and overactivity of eosinophils and mast cells is occurring.","Experiments dating back a decade or longer to identify novel surface markers selectively expressed on eosinophils and mast cells were undertaken with the hope that this would lead to the development of new cell type specific targets for therapy. This review will discuss the effort that led to the discovery of Siglec 8, and its closest function mouse paralog, Siglec F. After a brief review of the Siglec receptor family, Siglec 8 and Siglec F function on human eosinophils, and Siglec 8 function on mast cells, will be covered, followed by a discussion of their shared glycan ligands and known in vivo biology . Strategies designed to interrupt each of these events are being used as therapeutic agents or are being developed, and range from small molecule receptor antagonists to biologicals capable of neutralizing IgE, cytokines and other proteins .Additional independent work using a comparative transcriptome approach has confirmed the highly selective nature of Siglec 8 expression by eosinophils . This material could be isolated, amplified and then randomly sequenced.

165,"purpose of the review this article provides an update on the current progress in identification of kcnq4 mutations responsible for progressive hearing loss in dfna2. recent findings the kcnq4 gene has been identified at dfna2 locus on the human chromosome 1p34. dfna2 is a subtype of autosomal dominant nonsyndromic progressive hearing loss, characterized by hearing loss starting at high frequencies in the twenties and thirties, and then progressing to more than db with middle and low frequencies often affected as well, in less than years. to date, eight missense mutations and two deletions of the kcnq4 gene have been identified in dfna2 patients with various clinical phenotypes. in general, missense mutations are associated with younger onset and all frequency hearing loss, while deletion mutations are underlying later onset and pure high frequency hearing loss. the etiology of dfna2 remains largely unknown at this point, even though the degeneration of cochlear outer hair cells, caused by dysfunction of kcnq4 channels, might be one of the underlying mechanisms. summary during the last decade, significant progress has been made in identifying kcnq4 mutations in dfna2 patients. elucidation of the pathogenic effect of these mutations will help to gain insights to the molecular mechanisms of hearing and hearing loss, which, in turn, will facilitate informative genetic counseling, early diagnosis, and even treatment of hearing loss.","For example, mutations of KCNQ channels results in deafness in humans, as seen in Jervell and Lange Nielsen syndrome (JLNS) and autosomal dominant nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss DFNA2 . Deletions, on the other hand, cause a frame shift, resulting in the truncated channels that are nonfunctional . The past several years have witnessed a period of breathtaking discovery regarding mutations in a variety of ion channel and co transporter genes, which result in dysfunctional K+ regulation in the inner ear and eventually hearing loss .It has been estimated that more than half of the cases of childhood deafness are hereditary, while the rest are attributed to environmental factors. Genetic factors interact with the environment even when there seems to be a clear environmental determinant, as individuals may be genetically predisposed to hearing loss induced by noise, drugs, or infection. 10.1097/MOO.0b013e32830f4aa3 Current opinion in otolaryngology & head and neck surgery Deafness is one of the most common communication disorders in humans.The GJB3 gene encodes connexin31, a gap junction protein, whereas the KCNQ4 gene encodes a voltage gated potassium channel.

166,"using survey data on low income mothers in boston, chicago, and san antonio (n = 1,722) supplemented with ethnographic data, we test propositions regarding mothers attitudes toward childbearing, marriage, and divorce. these are drawn from edin & kefalas (2005) but have also arisen in other recent studies. we find strong support for the proposition that childbearing outside of marriage carries little stigma, limited support for the proposition that women prefer to have children well before marrying, and almost no support for the proposition that women hesitate to marry because they fear divorce. we suggest that mothers attitudes and preferences in these domains do not support the long delay between childbearing and marriage that has been noted in the literature. throughout, we are able to study attitudes among several hispanic groups as well as among african americans and non hispanic whites.","Moreover, people with less education seem to be more likely to approve of divorce. More recently, the question has reemerged as part of the policy debates over government programs to promote marriage among the low income population . Even if a woman became pregnant before marrying, she and her partner often married whether they had planned to or not in the latter case, submitting to a so called shotgun wedding.However, whereas worries regarding a failed relationship are mentioned, divorce is not.

167,"the chronicity of pain is the feature of pain that is least understood and most directly linked with our inability to effectively manage pain. acute pain is relatively responsive to our current pharmacologic and interventional armamentarium. however, as pain persists, our ability to treat effectively diminishes and the patient's frustration and resource utilization increases. this article explores our current understanding of the factors linked to pain duration and the transition from acute to chronic pain in both human and animal models, and across a spectrum of human chronic pain conditions.","All of these elements make the occurrence of chronic pain following injury (especially nerve injury) seem rather predictable. As a result, our understanding of the specific variables influencing pain duration has been poorly elucidated. This article highlights animal and human research explicitly examining pain duration and the shift from acute to chronic pain .Unlike the epidemiologic studies previously described, postsurgical studies look among a group in whom all have an injury. Nonetheless, the study concluded that anxiety and aggressivity were correlated with prolonged postsurgical pain . Pain related fear causes patients with pain to overpredict the severity of pain they will experience.Finally, there is a tremendous gap in the literature on postsurgical pain duration, with a great need for studies to test whether we can intervene therapeutically to reduce the duration of acute and subacute pain for the 34 million Americans undergoing surgery every year. However, these studies have not investigated the link between this long term outcome for a minority of patients with their effects of pain duration more generally among all comers. In other words, is the reduction in chronic pain seen with these agents a manifestation of altering the physiology that controls pain duration more generally?","All of these elements make the occurrence of chronic pain following injury (especially nerve injury) seem rather predictable.

168,"micrornas (mirnas) are ~22 nucleotides long, noncoding rnas that control cellular function by either degrading mrnas or arresting their translation. to understand their functional significance in ischemic pathophysiology, we profiled mirnas in adult rat brain as a function of reperfusion time after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. of the mirnas evaluated, showed increased and showed decreased expression at least at out of reperfusion time points studied between h and days compared with sham. of those, showed >5 fold change. bioinformatics analysis indicated a correlation between mirnas altered to several mrnas known to mediate inflammation, transcription, neuroprotection, receptors function, and ionic homeostasis. antagomir mediated prevention of mir 145 expression led to an increased protein expression of its downstream target superoxide dismutase 2 in the postischemic brain. in silico analysis showed sequence complementarity of eight mirnas induced after focal ischemia to promoters indicating the possibility of noncoding rna induced activation of gene expression. the mrna expression of the rnases drosha and dicer, cofactor pasha, and the pre mirna transporter exportin 5, which modulate mirna biogenesis, were not altered after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. thus, the present studies indicate a critical role of mirnas in controlling mrna transcription and translation in the postischemic brain.","In addition, recent studies indicated that mRNAs are finely controlled by a group of small noncoding, evolutionarily conserved RNAs of ~22 nucleotides (nt) long called microRNAs (miRNAs) (; ; ; ; ).

Performance difficulties on this task have also been associated with subcortical lacunar infarcts, which are thought to disrupt frontal subcortical circuits, in non demented elderly individuals . Additionally, performance is evaluated both in terms of the total number of correct target concepts reflected in the examinee's sorts, as well as the accuracy and level of abstraction of the examinee's sort descriptions, which is useful in discerning the specific sorting strategies that were employed .Following each sort, the examinee is queried regarding the sorting strategy that was employed. The addition of total brain volume did not result in a significant increase in explained variance (Fchange = .012; p = .913). For the analysis of the relationships between specific MRI lobar volumes and DST measures, we conducted two separate hierarchical repression analyses, one with the free description score as the dependent measure and the second with total number of confirmed correct sorts serving as the dependent measure.These left frontal mediated processes are highly pertinent to DST performance. Thus, a more concise understanding of the brain behavior relationships reflected in tasks like the DST requires comparisons of patients with circumscribed focal frontal and non frontal lesions.

170,"digital breast tomosynthesis (dbt) mammography is a promising imaging technique that has the potential to improve detection of early stage breast cancers. dbt mammography can provide quasi three dimensional information by reconstructing the breast volume from a number of low dose mammograms acquired over a limited angular range. previous studies have shown that iterative reconstruction methods such as simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique (sart) can give satisfactory image quality in dbt. however, due to the finite size of the detector and the limited field of view, dbt reconstruction contains artifacts caused by the truncated projection view (pv) images. we developed methods that use a local intensity equalization strategy and a geometrical tissue compensation method to remove two types of truncation artifacts: detector boundary discontinuity and underestimation of the attenuation pathlength. a custom built breast phantom and a selected dbt patient case were used to evaluate the improvements. a ge prototype dbt system was used to acquire pvs in increments over a angular range. experimental results demonstrated that the artifact reduction methods can improve the image quality at the boundaries with enhanced contrast to noise ratio and increased background uniformity, recover the obscured breast structural information, and achieve an overall reconstruction quality comparable to that without truncation.","Consistency and continuity constraints are utilized in these methods to facilitate parameter estimation and avoid characteristic artifacts at the edge of the truncated boundary.

173,"quinones such as ubiquinone are the lipid soluble electron and proton carriers in the membranes of mitochondria, chloroplasts and oxygenic bacteria. quinones undergo controlled redox reactions bound to specific sites in integral membrane proteins such as the cytochrome bc1 oxidoreductase. the quinone reactions in bacterial photosynthesis are amongst the best characterized, presenting a model to understand how proteins modulate cofactor chemistry. the free energy of ubiquinone redox reactions in aqueous solution and in the qa and qb sites of the bacterial photosynthetic reaction centers (rcs) are compared. in the primary qa site ubiquinone is reduced only to the anionic semiquinone (q) while in the secondary qb site the product is the doubly reduced, doubly protonated quinol (qh2). the ways in which the protein modifies the relative energy of each reduced and protonated intermediate are described. for example, the protein stabilizes q while destabilizing q= relative to aqueous solution through electrostatic interactions. in addition, kinetic and thermodynamic mechanisms for stabilizing the intermediate semiquinones are compared. evidence for the protein sequestering anionic compounds by slowing both on and off rates as well as by binding the anion more tightly is reviewed.","All but Q and QH2 are unstable in water or membrane under physiological conditions. They can also kinetically trap the intermediates so they are not lost to the surroundings.

174,the novel h1n1 influenza virus that emerged in humans in mexico in early and transmitted efficiently in the human population with global spread has been declared a pandemic strain. here we review influenza infections in swine since and the introduction of different avian and human influenza virus genes into swine influenza viruses of north america and eurasia. these introductions often result in viruses of increased fitness for pigs that occasionally transmit to humans. the novel virus affecting humans is derived from a north american swine influenza virus that has acquired two gene segments (neuraminidase (na) and matrix (m)) from the european swine lineages. this reassortant appears to have increased fitness in humans. the potential for increased virulence in humans and of further reassortment between the novel h1n1 influenza virus and oseltamivir resistant seasonal h1n1 or with highly pathogenic h5n1 influenza stresses the need for urgent pandemic planning.,"The polymerase complex includes the PB2, PB1 and PA proteins as well as the nucleoprotein (NP). There are two surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). The two most recent human pandemic influenza A viruses were created through the reassortment of human and avian viruses.All of the currently circulating viruses contain a genetically similar constellation of internal genes, but have different surface glycoproteins. This virus entered the human and swine population around the same time and evolved independently in each host . Several wholly avian viruses, including an H4N6, H3N3, and H1N1 have been isolated from swine herds in Canada, but none have spread beyond the initially infected herds .Where this event occurred can only be speculated about. On 11 June 2009, the WHO raised the pandemic alert from Level 5 to Level 6 and declared the start of an influenza pandemic .

175,"this paper reports a reversible switching of the biological activity of an rna molecule, packaging rna (prna), which is a central component of the dna packaging motor of bacteriophage phi29. the switching mechanism contains two components: (1) inhibiting prna by a short antisense dna (asdna) that can bind to the 3 end of the prna and inactivate the packaging motor; and (2) reactivating prna by isothermally removing asdna from prna through a strand displacement strategy. the switching process can be repeated for multiple cycles and has been demonstrated by gel electrophoresis and a virion assembly assay.","However, this inhibition was irreversible. The DNA pRNA complex persisted. The process is sequence specific and takes place under isothermal conditions.In brief, 1 l of pRNA (0.1 mg/ml) or pRNA DNA complexes was mixed with 10 l of purified procapsids (0.3 mg/ml), dialyzed on a 0.025 m pore size membrane (V Series Membrane; Millipore Corp.) for 15 min. against TBE (89 mM Tris borate 2.5 mM EDTA, pH 8.3), and the buffer was switched to TMS (50 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, pH 8.0) for 30 min. further dialysis. After 30 min. at ambient temperature, excess amount of neck, tail, and morphogenic proteins were added to the DNA packaging reaction to complete assembly of infectious virions.

176,"dengue viruses (denv) are the etiological agents of dengue fever (df) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (dhf). the denv complex consists of four closely related viruses designated denv serotypes through 4. although infection with one serotype induces cross reactive antibody to all serotypes, the long term protective antibody response is restricted to the serotype responsible for infection. cross reactive antibodies appear to enhance infection during a second infection with a different serotype. the goal of the present study was to characterize the binding specificity and functional properties of human denv immune sera. the study focused on domain iii of the viral envelope protein (ediii), as this region has a well characterized epitope that is recognized by strongly neutralizing serotype specific mouse monoclonal antibodies (mabs). our results demonstrate that ediii reactive antibodies are present in primary and secondary denv immune human sera. human antibodies bound to a serotype specific epitope on ediii after primary infection and a serotype cross reactive epitope on ediii after secondary infection. however, ediii binding antibodies constituted only a small fraction of the total antibody in immune sera binding to denv. studies with complete and ediii antibody depleted human immune sera demonstrated that ediii binding antibodies play a minor role in denv neutralization. we propose that human antibodies directed to other epitopes on the virus are primarily responsible for denv neutralization. our results have implications for understanding protective immunity following natural denv infection and for evaluating denv vaccines.","However, the antibodies only provide long term protection against the serotype responsible for the original infection and people can be infected a second time with a different serotype .

177,"particular guanine rich nucleic acid sequences can fold into stable secondary structures called g quadruplexes. these structures have been identified in various regions of the genome that include the telomeres, gene promoters and utr regions, raising the possibility that they may be associated with biological function(s). computational analysis has predicted that intramolecular g quadruplex forming sequences are prevalent in the human genome, thus raising the desire to differentially recognize genomic g quadruplexes. we have employed antibody phage display and competitive selection techniques to generate a single chain antibody that shows >1000 fold discrimination between g quadruplex and duplex dna, and furthermore >100 fold discrimination between two related intramolecular parallel dna g quadruplexes. the amino acid sequence composition at the antigen binding site shows conservation within the light and heavy chains of the selected scfvs, suggesting sequence requirements for g quadruplex recognition. circular dichroism (cd) spectroscopic data showed that the scfv binds to the prefolded g quadruplex and does not induce g quadruplex structure formation. this study demonstrates the strongest discrimination that we are aware of between two intramolecular genomic g quadruplexes.","Another strategy has been to select or engineer proteins that recognize particular G quadruplexes. Herein we report on a single chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody selected by phage display and competitive selection that binds to a human parallel intramolecular DNA G quadruplex with high affinity. There are various classes of G quadruplex structure that can form, depending on strand molecularity, and within each class, there are subtypes that vary according to the strand polarities.Expression of soluble scFvs and ELISA were conducted as mentioned in the MRC protocol (http://www.geneservice.co.uk/products/proteomic/datasheets/tomlinsonIJ.pdf). Briefly, individual colonies of HB2151 infected with the eluted phage were grown in 96 well microtiter plates till OD600 nm was approximately 0.9 and then were induced with IPTG. The standard ELISA protocol was followed, but 50 mM Tris HCl containing 100 mM KCl instead of PBS was used to maintain the G quadruplex conformation.To the best of our knowledge, the single chain antibody hf2 is the first reported example of a molecule that shows large discrimination (>100 fold) between 2 folded intramolecular DNA G quadruplexes formed from human genomic sequences. While G quadruplexes share structural features and commonly exhibit structural polymorphism, it has been suggested that the loops offer the potential for discrimination at the molecular level.

183,"catechins are a major constituent of green tea. for green tea to have cancer therapeutic benefit, catechin concentrations in the range of nm are required continuously until apoptosis (programmed cell death) is induced. to prolong elevated plasma and interstitial concentrations of catechins, a sustained release formulation of green tea extract was tested and compared to a commercial green tea extract (tegreen97). sustained release formulations are usually developed in the pharmaceutical industry to slowly deliver the compound over a period of time and increase the dosing interval. plasma and interstitial fluid (isf) pharmacokinetics of catechins were determined following an oral dose in the rat. the sustained release formulation profile included multiple smaller peaks of total catechins in both plasma and isf. interstitial fluid profiles of green tea extract indicate that higher catechins concentration and longer duration in tissue than in blood may make a sustained release form unnecessary.","Anticancer effects for tea are indicated both from animal in vivo studies (; ;; ) and from human epidemiological observations .

184,"background vestibular evoked myogenic potential (vemp) testing has gained increased interest in the diagnosis of a variety of vestibular etiologies. comparisons of p13 / n23 latency, amplitude and threshold response curves have been used to compare pathologic groups to normal controls. appropriate characterization of these etiologies requires normative data across the frequency spectrum and age range. purpose the objective of the current study was to test the hypothesis that significant changes in vemp responses occur as a function of increased age across all test stimuli as well as characterize the vemp threshold response curve across age. research design this project incorporated a prospective study design using a sample of convenience. openly recruited subjects were assigned to groups according to age. study sample forty six normal controls ranging between and years of age participated in the study. participants were separated by decade into age categories from to plus years. normal participants were characterized by having normal hearing sensitivity, no history of neurologic or balance/dizziness involvement and negative results on a direct office vestibular examination. intervention vemp responses were measured at threshold to click and 250, 500, 750, and hz tone burst stimuli and at a suprathreshold level to hz toneburst stimuli at123 dbspl. data collection and analysis a mixed group factorial anova and linear regression were performed to examine the effects of vemp characteristics upon age. results there were no significant differences between ears for any of the test parameters. there were no significant differences between age groups for n23 latency or amplitude in response to any of the stimuli. significant mean differences did exist between age groups for p13 latency (250, 750, and hz) and threshold (500 and hz). age was significantly correlated with vemp parameters. vemp threshold was positively correlated (250, 500, 750, hz); and amplitude was negatively correlated (500 hz maximum). the threshold response curves revealed best frequency tuning at hz with the highest thresholds in response to click stimuli. however, this best frequency tuning dissipated with increased age. vemp response rates also decreased with increased age. conclusion we have demonstrated that minor differences in vemp responses occur with age. given the reduced response rates and flattened frequency tuning curve for individuals over the age of 60, frequency tuning curves may not be a good diagnostic indicator for this age group.","VEMP responses are considered to be a reflection of vestibulospinal projections to the neck, which give rise to information regarding saccule and inferior vestibular nerve integrity .

189,"telomere length analysis has been greatly simplified by the quantitative flow cytometry technique flow fish. in this method, a fluorescein labeled synthetic oligonucleotide complementary to the telomere terminal repeat sequence is hybridized to the telomere sequence and the resulting fluorescence measured by flow cytometry. this technique has supplanted the traditional laborious southern blot telomere length measurement techniques in many laboratories, and allows single cell analysis of telomere length in high throughput sample formats. nevertheless, the harsh conditions required for telomere probe annealing (82c) has made it difficult to successfully combine this technique with simultaneous immunolabeling. most traditional organic fluorescent probes (i.e. fluorescein, phycoerythrin, etc.) have limited thermal stability and do not survive the high temperature annealing process, despite efforts to covalently crosslink the antigen antibody fluorophore complex. this loss of probe fluorescence has made it difficult to measure flow fish in complex lymphocyte populations, and has generally forced investigators to use fluorescent activated cell sorting to pre separate their populations, a laborious technique that requires prohibitively large numbers of cells. in this study, we have substituted quantum dots (nanoparticles) for traditional fluorophores in fish flow. quantum dots were demonstrated to possess much greater thermal stability than traditional low molecular weight and phycobiliprotein fluorophores. quantum dot antibody conjugates directed against monocyte and t cell antigens were found to retain most of their fluorescence following the high temperature annealing step, allowing simultaneous fluorescent immunophenotyping and telomere length measurement. since quantum dots have very narrow emission bandwidths, we were able to analyze multiple quantum dot antibody conjugates (qdot 605, and 705) simultaneously with fish flow measurement to assess the age associated decline in telomere length in both human monocytes and t cell subsets. with quantum dot immunolabeling, the mean decrease rate in telomere length for cd4+ cells was calculated at 41.8bp/year, very close to previously reported values using traditional flow fish and southern blotting. this modification to the traditional flow fish technique should therefore allow simultaneous fluorescent immunophenotyping and telomere length measurement, permitting complex cell subset specific analysis in small numbers of cells without the requirement for prior cell sorting.","Previous studies have analyzed two cell subpopulations of CD8+ lymphocytes using the fluorescent probes Alexa Fluor 488 and Alexa Fluor 546 for cell surface staining .

190,"sonoporation uses ultrasound (us) to generate transient non selective pores on the cell membrane and has been exploited as a non viral intracellular drug and gene delivery strategy. the pore size determines the size of agents that can be delivered into the cytoplasm using the technique. however, measurements of the dynamic, submicron scale pores have not been readily available. electron microscopy or atomic force microscopy has been used to gauge pore size but such techniques are intrinsically limited to post us measurements that may not accurately reveal the relevant information. as previously demonstrated, changes of the transmembrane current (tmc) of a single cell under voltage clamp can be used for monitoring sonoporation in real time. because the tmc is related to the diffusion of ions through the pores on the membrane, it can potentially provide information of the pore size generated in sonoporation. using xenopus laevis oocytes as the model system, the tmc of single cells under voltage clamp was measured in real time to assess formation of pores on the membrane in sonoporation. the cells were exposed to us (0.2 s, 0.3 mpa, 1.075 mhz) in the presence of definity microbubbles. experiments were designed to obtain the tmc corresponding to a single pore on the membrane. the size of the pores was estimated from an electro diffusion model that relates the tmc with pore size from the ion transport through the pores on the membrane. the mean radius of single pores was determined to be nm with standard deviation of nm. this study reports the first results of pore size from the tmc measured using the voltage clamp technique.","Applicable for quasi steady state situations, we only consider the maximum pore size from the maximum TMC in this study, while the radius as a function of time can be derived from the time dependent TMC values . As the change of TMC is the result of ions flowing through all the transient pores generated on the membrane and thus related to the total area of all the pores, the TMC can be used to estimate the size of the pores. Ultrasound (US) induced cell membrane porosity, or sonoporation, has shown its unique potential in intracellular drug and gene delivery via generation of non specific openings or pores on the cell membrane.Previous work has suggested that the microbubbles which facilitate cavitation must be close to the cell membrane to be effective in generating pores . On the other hand, ppore can be calculated as the ratio of the number of the experimental tests in which a change of TMC is measured (ncurr) over the total number of tests ntot, or ncurr/ntot.

191,"liver fibrosis is currently staged using needle biopsy, a highly invasive procedure with a number of disadvantages. measurement of liver stiffness changes that accompany progression of the disease may provide a quantitative and non invasive method to assess the health of the liver. the purpose of this study is to investigate the correlation between liver stiffness measured by radiation force induced shear waves and disease related changes in the liver. an additional aim is to present initial findings on the effects of liver viscosity on radiation force induced shear wave morphology. liver fibrosis was induced in rats using carbon tetrachloride (ccl4), while rats acted as controls. liver stiffness was measured in vivo in all rats after a treatment period of weeks using a modified siemens sonoline antares scanner. the spatial coherence of radiation force induced shear waves propagating in the viscoelastic rat liver decreased significantly with propagation distance, compared to shear waves in an elastic phantom, and a finite element model of a purely elastic medium. animals were sacrificed after imaging and liver samples were taken for histopathological analysis and collagen quantification using picosirius red staining and hydroxyproline assay. at the end of the treatment period, rats had healthy livers (stage f0), while had severe fibrosis (f3), and the rest had light to moderate fibrosis (f1 and f2). the measured liver stiffness for the f0 group was 1.5 0.1kpa (mean 95% confidence interval), and for f3 livers was 1.8 0.2kpa. in this study, liver stiffness was found to be linearly correlated with the amount of collagen in the liver measured by picosirius red staining (r2 = 0.43, p = 0.008). in addition, stiffness spatial heterogeneity was also linearly correlated with liver collagen content (r2 = 0.58, p = 0.001) by picosirius red staining. these results are consistent with those obtained by salameh et al (2007) and yin et al (2007b) using animal models of liver fibrosis and mr elastography. this suggests that stiffness measurement using acoustic radiation force can provide a quantitative assessment of the extent of fibrosis in the liver and can be potentially used for the diagnosis, management, and study of liver fibrosis.","Lastly, repeat liver biopsies are not well tolerated, and therefore not appropriate for monitoring disease progression or response to antifibrotic therapies. Liver fibrosis is the common result of various causes of chronic damage to the liver, including infections, toxins, autoimmune disorder, cholestatic and metabolic diseases .

193,"both the dorsal and ventral striatum have been demonstrated to have a critical role in reinforcement learning and addiction. dissecting the specific function of these striatal compartments and their associated nigrostriatal and mesoaccumbens dopamine pathways, however, has proved difficult. previous studies using lesions to isolate the contribution of nigrostriatal and mesoaccumbens dopamine in mediating the locomotor and reinforcing effects of psychostimulant drugs have yielded inconsistent and inconclusive results. using a naturally occurring mutant mouse line, aphakia, that lacks a nigrostriatal dopamine pathway but retains an intact mesoaccumbens pathway, we show that the locomotor activating effects of cocaine, including locomotor sensitization, are dependent on an intact nigrostriatal dopamine projection. in contrast, cocaine reinforcement, as measured by conditioned place preference and cocaine sensitization of sucrose preference, is intact in these mice. in light of the well established role of the nucleus accumbens in mediating the effects of psychostimulants, these data suggest that the nigrostriatal pathway can act as a critical effector mechanism for the nucleus accumbens highlighting the importance of intrastriatal connectivity and providing insight into the functional architecture of the striatum.","The mutation is recessive and heterozygote mice are normal (; ; ).

199,"psychiatric illnesses are disabling disorders with poorly understood underlying pathophysiologies. however, it is becoming increasingly evident that these illnesses result from disruptions across whole cellular networks rather than any particular monoamine system. recent evidence continues to support the hypothesis that these illnesses arise from impairments in cellular plasticity cascades, which lead to aberrant information processing in the circuits that regulate mood, cognition, and neurovegetative functions (sleep, appetite, energy, etc). as a result, many have begun to consider future therapies that would be capable of affecting global changes in cellular plasticity to restore appropriate synaptic function and neuronal connectivity. micrornas (mirnas) are non coding rnas that can repress the gene translation of hundreds of their targets and are therefore well positioned to target a multitude of cellular mechanisms. here, we review some properties of micrornas and show they are altered by stress, glucocorticoids, mood stabilizers, and in a particular psychiatric disorder, schizophrenia. while this field is still in its infancy, we consider their potential for regulating behavioral phenotypes and targeting key predicted signaling cascades that are implicated in psychiatric illness. clearly, considerable research is required to better determine any therapeutic potential of targeting micrornas; however, these agents may provide the next generation of effective therapies for psychiatric illnesses.","Accumulating evidence indicates that miRNAs may act as key regulators in a large number of different cellular processes, including early development, proliferation, apoptosis, metabolism, and cell differentiation. Psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder (BPD), and major depressive disorder (MDD) are debilitating afflictions, and present a substantial burden to society. No particular disorder or behaviroal phenotype has been shown to correlate conclusively with any individual gene variant across multiple studies.Collectively, these data also expand our understanding of the complex regulation of circadian rhythms, which appear to occur not only through transcriptional feedback mechanisms, but also via miRNA mediated translational control . In rodents, Cheng and Obrietan found that two miRNAsmiR 219 and miR 132were regulated in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) by the light inducible transcription factor cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). In drosophila, a microarray platform was used to mine miRNAs differentially regulated in the adult heads of wildtype flies compared to arrhythmic clock mutant cyc01 flies.Accumulating evidence indicates that miRNAs act as key regulators in a large number of different cellular processes such as early development, apoptosis, and metabolism, as well as cell proliferation, differentiation, and death. Several types of miRNAs have been found in the CNS, and these respond to stress and regulate morphogenesis in different cells, including neurons. Because miRNAs act on multiple plasticity cascades, targeting them may prove to be effective in the development of novel therapeutics for psychiatric disorders.","Accumulating evidence indicates that miRNAs may act as key regulators in a large number of different cellular processes, including early development, proliferation, apoptosis, metabolism, and cell differentiation.

201,"the split product of the complement protein, c5, is c5a and is an extremely potent pro inflammatory peptide that interacts with two c5a receptors, c5ar and c5l2, present on surfaces of phagocytes as well as other cell types. the former is a well established receptor that initiates g protein coupled signaling via mitogen activated protein kinase pathways. its in vivo blockade greatly reduces inflammatory injury. much less is known about c5l2, occupancy of which by c5a does not initiate increased intracellular ca2+. there are numerous conflicting reports suggesting that c5l2 is a default receptor that attenuates c5a dependent biological responses by competing with c5ar for binding of c5a. however, there are other reports suggesting that c5l2 plays an active, positive role in inflammatory responses. better definition of c5l2 is needed if its in vivo blockade, along with c5ar, is to be considered in complement dependent inflammatory diseases.","The initial structural characterization in 1991 [, ] of the rhodopsin like receptor for C5a, C5aR , and the receptor for N formyl Met Leu Phe provided key biochemical information that would permit development of antibodies and synthetic inhibitors to these receptors, for which C5aR binds C5a with high affinity and initiates G protein dependent cascade of cell responses (increased intracellular Ca2+, granule fusion with the cell membrane, enzyme release, on oxidative burst [H2O2 production], etc.).

206,"narrative comprehension rests on the ability to understand the intentions and perceptions of various agents in a story who interact with respect to some goal or problem. reasoning about the state of mind of another person, real or fictional, has been referred to as theory of mind processing. while theory of mind processing was first postulated prior to the existence of neuroimaging research, fmri studies make it possible to characterize this processing in some detail. we propose that narrative comprehension makes use of some of the neural substrate of theory of mind reasoning, evoking what is referred to as a protagonist perspective network. the main cortical components of this protagonist based network are the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and the right temporo parietal junction. the article discusses how these two cortical centers interact in narrative comprehension but still play distinguishable roles, and how the interaction between the two centers is disrupted in individuals with autism.","The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows.

207,"summary endocytosis is essential in maintaining exocytosis at secretory cells. rapid endocytosis with a time course less than a few seconds is widely observed at nerve terminals and non neuronal secretory cells. it is generally assumed that rapid endocytosis recycles vesicles within the readily releasable pool (rrp) via a kiss and run mechanism that involves rapid opening and closure of a fusion pore at the release site. the present work suggests that both rapid ( < s) and slow ( = s) endocytosis do not recycle vesicles to the rrp, but to a recycling pool at least a few times larger than the rrp at a nerve terminal, the calyx of held in rat brain stem. challenging the long held view that rapid endocytosis offers a rapid, local vesicle recycling within the rrp, our finding calls for re consideration of the function and the underlying mechanism of rapid endocytosis. we suggest that rapid endocytosis provides the nerve terminal the ability to recycle vesicles rapidly via the recycling pool, and to maintain the normal morphology of the nerve terminal, including the release site, by rapidly clearing the fused vesicle membrane from the release site during intense firing.","However, whether rapid endocytosis must be due to kiss and run is unclear .

208,"this paper presents a new automatic high order shimming method that maps b0 field using a group of parallel columns. it was found that a pair of four columns in two separate slices could determine an optimal correction field comprising the spherical harmonic terms up to the third order. the technique of multiple stimulated echoes was incorporated into the method, allowing the use of at least eight shots to accomplish field mapping. the shim currents were first determined in the logic frame by assuming that the slices were in axial planes, and then uniquely converted into the physical frame where the slices could be at any oblique angle, by using a spherical harmonics rotation transformation. this method thus works regardless of slice orientation. it was demonstrated on a t scanner equipped with a complete set of second order harmonic shim coils. both phantom and in vivo experiments showed that this newly introduced high order shimming method is an effective and efficient way to reduce field inhomogeneity for a region of imaging slices.","This method was subsequently extended to multiple slices by dynamic shim updating for individual slices .

215,"the human multidrug resistance transporter p glycoprotein (p gp) prevents the entry of compounds into the brain by an active efflux mechanism at the blood brain barrier (bbb). treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, therefore, has become a challenge and the development of new reversible inhibitors of p gp is pertinent to overcome this problem. we report the design and synthesis of a crosslinked agent based on the alzheimers disease treatment galantamine (gal 2) that inhibits p gp mediated efflux from cultured cells. gal 2 was found to inhibit the efflux of the fluorescent p gp substrate rhodamine in cancer cells that over express p gp with an ic50 value of approximately 0.8 m. in addition, gal 2 was found to inhibit the efflux of therapeutic substrates of p gp, such as doxorubicin, daunomycin and verapamil with ic50 values ranging from 0.5 m m. through competition experiments, it was determined that gal 2 modulates p gp mediated efflux by competing for the substrate binding sites. these findings support a potential role of agents, such as gal 2, as inhibitors of p gp at the bbb to augment treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.","We now describe a novel bivalent agent based on the Alzheimers disease treatment galantamine, Gal 2, that is an effective inhibitor of the binding and transport activity of P gp . P gp belongs to the superfamily of ATP Binding Cassette (ABC) membrane transporters and is encoded by the MDR 1 (ABCB1) gene in humans . P gp has been shown to contain at least two distinct substrate binding sites, which are located in the transmembrane regions of the protein [,,].(A) and (B) were analyzed by flow cytometry while (C) was analyzed using a scintillation counter . (A) Synthesis of Gal 2 starting with monomeric galantamine. Sf9 cells were cultured at 27C in SF 900 II SFM medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 0.5X antibiotic antimycotic (Invitrogen) .The secondary hydroxyl group of galantamine was used as the site of dimerization with an appropriate di carboxylic acid containing tether. At this concentration, Gal 2 was also approximately 20% more active than the known P gp inhibitor GF120918 . Given the important role that P gp plays in protecting the brain from entry of these drugs, the design of such dimeric agents would be useful for blocking the efflux of neurodegenerative disease drugs at the BBB.","We now describe a novel bivalent agent based on the Alzheimers disease treatment galantamine, Gal 2, that is an effective inhibitor of the binding and transport activity of P gp .

217,"scanning electrochemical microscopy (secm) is developed as a powerful approach to electrochemical characterization of individual one dimensional (1d) nanostructures under unbiased conditions. 1d nanostructures comprise high aspect ratio materials with both nanoscale and macroscale dimensions such as nanowires, nanotubes, nanobelts, and nanobands. finite element simulations demonstrate that the feedback current at a disk shaped ultramicroelectrode tip positioned above an unbiased nanoband, as prepared on an insulating substrate, is sensitive to finite dimensions of the band, i.e., micrometer length, nanometer width, and nanometer height from the insulating surface. the electron transfer rate of a redox mediator at the nanoband surface depends not only on the intrinsic rate but also on the open circuit potential of the nanoband, which is determined by the dimensions of the nanoband as well as the tip inner and outer radii, and tipsubstrate distance. the theoretical predictions are confirmed experimentally by employing au nanobands as fabricated on a sio2 surface by electron beam lithography, thereby yielding well defined dimensions of or nm in width, nm in height, and m in length. a nm wide nanoband can be detected by secm imaging with m diameter tips although the tip feedback current is compromised by finite electron transfer kinetics for ru(nh3)63+ at the nanoband surface.","The theoretical predictions are assessed experimentally by investigating 50 m long Au nanobands with 100 or 500 nm in width and 47 nm in height as fabricated on the SiO2 surface by electron beam lithography.

222,"the manner in which hippocampus processes neural signals is thought to be central to the memory encoding process. a theoretically oriented literature has suggested that this is carried out via attractors or distinctive spatio temporal patterns of activity. however, these ideas have not been thoroughly investigated using computational models featuring both realistic single cell physiology and detailed cell to cell connectivity. here we present a cell simulation based on traub et als pyramidal cell [81] and interneuron [83] models, incorporating patterns of synaptic connectivity based on an extensive review of the neuroanatomic literature. when stimulated with a one second physiologically realistic input, our simulated tissue shows the ability to hold activity on line for several seconds; furthermore, its spiking activity, as measured by frequency and interspike interval (isi) distributions, resembles that of in vivo hippocampus. an interesting emergent property of the system is its tendency to transition from stable state to stable state, a behavior consistent with recent experimental findings [73]. inspection of spike trains and simulated blockade of kahp channels suggest that this is mediated by spike frequency adaptation. this finding, in conjunction with studies showing that apamin, a kahp channel blocker, enhances the memory consolidation process in laboratory animals, suggests the formation of stable attractor states is central to the process by which memories are encoded. ways that this methodology could shed light on the etiology of mental illness, such as schizophrenia, are discussed.","Menschik and Finkel modeled CA3 and included the effects of acetylcholine to better understand the etiology of Alzheimers Disease.

223,"the ability to perceive sequences is fundamental to cognition. previous studies have shown that infants can learn visual sequences as early as months of age and it has been suggested that this ability is mediated by sensitivity to conditional probability information. typically, conditional probability information has covaried with frequency information in these studies raising the possibility that each type of information may have contributed independently to sequence learning. the current study explicitly investigated the independent contribution of each type of information. we habituated 2.5 , 4.5 , and 8.5 month old infants to a sequence of looming visual shapes whose ordering was defined independently by specific conditional probability relations among pair elements and by the frequency of occurrence of such pairs. during test trials, we tested infants sensitivity to each type of information and found that both types of information independently influenced sequence learning by 4.5 months of age.","In a more recent spatio temporal version of the task, Kirkham, Slemmer, Richardson, and Johnson (2007) provided additional evidence of infant sensitivity to conditional probability information. In another study, , Exp. 2) investigated 9 month old infants response to the spatial relations among distinct objects making up a complex visual scene. The test trials indicated that the infants did detect the violations in the conditional probability relations.Once an infant reached the habituation criterion, the next trial constituted the start of the test phase . Whenever the infant looked at the monitor, the appropriate movie (i.e., trial) began and as soon as the infant either looked away from the monitor for more than two seconds or accumulated a total of 60 seconds of looking, the trial ended. To attract the infants attention back to the monitor following a look away, we presented a beeping sound through a set of speakers positioned on each side of the monitor.For example, infants must learn that both baby and basin are words despite the fact that the conditional probability within the word is indeterminate (i.e., less than 1). Sensitivity to frequency above and beyond statistics can serve to facilitate learning by allowing the infant to take advantage of multiple sources of information. 2Due to limitations in the programming software, we were unable to randomize shape pairing and order for every infant.","In a more recent spatio temporal version of the task, Kirkham, Slemmer, Richardson, and Johnson (2007) provided additional evidence of infant sensitivity to conditional probability information.

To attract the infants attention back to the monitor following a look away, we presented a beeping sound through a set of speakers positioned on each side of the monitor.For example, infants must learn that both baby and basin are words despite the fact that the conditional probability within the word is indeterminate (i.e., less than 1). Sensitivity to frequency above and beyond statistics can serve to facilitate learning by allowing the infant to take advantage of multiple sources of information. 2Due to limitations in the programming software, we were unable to randomize shape pairing and order for every infant.",0.36939313984168864,0.09549071618037136,0.233710552272659,0.36939313984168864,0.09549071618037136,0.233710552272659
224,"background individuals' beliefs about cancer heritability could affect their health information seeking and health behaviors. methods data from 5,813 english speaking adult respondents to the health information national trends survey were analyzed. results individuals who believed that knowledge of family history or genes can reduce cancer risk were significantly more likely to have ever looked for cancer information. ever smokers who believed that genes are the main cause of lung cancer were significantly more likely to smoke currently. conclusions patients need to be educated about genetic susceptibility to cancer in ways that support information seeking and engagement in protective behaviors.","Related studies investigating the effect of providing new genetic susceptibility information on health behaviors have had mixed findings. The rapidly advancing pace of research in genetics and genomics means that much information about the inherited component of cancer risk is becoming available to the public through a variety of sources. Some prior research indicated that diseases with a genetic cause may be conceptualized as less controllable or not preventable, beliefs that might inhibit individuals' information seeking.Two thirds reported having a family history of cancer (65%), while about 13% had been diagnosed with cancer themselves. Forty eight percent reported ever smoking; 42% of ever smokers were current smokers.

225,"marital stress has been associated with immune dysregulation, including increased production of interleukin 6 (il 6). attachment style, ones expectations about the availability and responsiveness of others in intimate relationships, appears to influence physiological stress reactivity and thus could influence inflammatory responses to marital conflict. thirty five couples were invited for two 24 hour admissions to a hospital research unit. the first visit included a structured social support interaction, while the second visit comprised the discussion of a marital disagreement. a mixed effect within subject repeated measure model indicated that attachment avoidance significantly influenced il 6 production during the conflict visit but not during the social support visit. individuals with higher attachment avoidance had on average an 11% increase in total il 6 production during the conflict visit as compared to the social support visit, while individuals with lower attachment avoidance had, on average, a 6% decrease in il 6 production during the conflict visit as compared to the social support visit. furthermore, greater attachment avoidance was associated with a higher frequency of negative behaviors and a lower frequency of positive behaviors during the marital interaction, providing a mechanism by which attachment avoidance may influence inflammatory responses to marital conflict. in sum, these results suggest that attachment avoidance modulates marital behavior and stress induced immune dysregulation.","Adulthood attachment style is defined along two dimensions.

234,"pulsed electron electron double resonance (peldor) measurements are presented from the potassium ion channel kcsa both solubilized in detergent and reconstituted in lipids. site directed spin labeling using mtsl was performed with a r64c mutant of the protein. the orientations of the spin labels in the tetramer were determined by peldor experiments performed at two magnetic field strengths (0.3 t / x band and 1.2 t / q band) and variable probe frequency. quantitative simulation of the peldor data supports a strongly restricted nitroxide, oriented at an angle of degrees relative to the central channel axis. in general, poorer quality peldor data was obtained from membrane reconstituted preparations compared to soluble proteins or detergent solubilized samples. one reason for this is the reduced transverse spin relaxation time t2 of nitroxides due to crowding of tetramers within the membrane that occurs even at low protein to lipid ratios. this reduced t2 can be overcome by reconstituting mixtures of unlabeled and labeled proteins, yielding high quality peldor data. identical peldor oscillation frequencies and their dependencies on the probe frequency were observed in the detergent and membrane reconstituted preparations indicating that the position and orientation of the spin labels are the same in both environments.",".

236,"recent work on the long term stability of memory and synaptic plasticity has identified a potentially critical role for protein kinase mzeta (pkm). pkm is a constitutively active, atypical isoform of protein kinase c that is believed to maintain long term potentiation at hippocampal synapses in vitro. in behaving animals, local inhibition of pkm disrupts spatial memory in the hippocampus and conditioned taste aversion memory in the insular cortex. the role of pkm in context fear memory is less clear. this study examined the role of pkm in amygdala and hippocampal neurons following a standard fear conditioning protocol. the results indicate that pkm inhibition in the amygdala, but not in the hippocampus, can disrupt fear memory. this suggests that pkm may only maintain select forms of memory in specific brain structures and does not participate in a universal memory storage mechanism.","Following this initial test, a number of follow up tests were performed to ensure that any observed memory deficits were long lasting and not attributable to tissue damage.

239,"metal uptake by the antioxidant defense metalloenzyme manganese superoxide dismutase (mnsod) is an essential step in the functional maturation of the protein that is just beginning to be investigated in detail. we have extended earlier in vitro studies on metal binding by the dimeric escherichia coli apo mnsod to investigate the mechanism of metal uptake by tetrameric human and thermus thermophilus apo mnsods. like the e. coli apo mnsod, these proteins also bind metal ions in vitro in a thermally activated, ph sensitive process. however, metal uptake by the tetrameric apo mnsods exhibits a number of important differences. in particular, there is no indication of conformational gating requirement for metal binding for these proteins, and the reaction is first order in metal ion. the high concentration of metal ion that is required to achieve physiologically relevant metallation rates for tetrameric human apo mnsod in vitro suggests the possibility that co translational metal binding or chaperone interactions may be required in vivo.","Proteins in this family typically assemble into symmetric multimers (dimers or tetramers) of identical subunits, and crystal structures are available for both dimeric and tetrameric proteins .

240,"the solvatochromic fluorophore 4 n,n dimethylamino 1,8 naphthalimide (4 dmn) possesses extremely sensitive emission properties due largely to the low intrinsic fluorescence it exhibits in polar protic solvents like water. this makes it well suited as a probe for the detection of a wide range of biomolecular interactions. herein we report the development and evaluation of a new series of thiol reactive agents derived from this fluorophore. the members of this series vary according to linker type and the electrophilic group required for the labeling of proteins and other biologically relevant molecules. using the calcium binding protein calmodulin as a model system, we compare the performance of the 4 dmn derivatives to that of several commercially available solvatochromic fluorophores identifying many key factors import to the successful application of such tools. this study also demonstrates the power of this new series of labeling agents by yielding a fluorescent calmodulin construct capable of producing a greater than 100 fold increase in emission intensity upon binding to calcium.","While these efforts have proved highly successful, our current aim has been to expand the scope of applications to include the integration of these tools into native proteins. Much of our former work with the dimethylaminophthalimide dyes focused on the development of fluorescent amino acids for incorporation into small peptide based probes designed to recognize and report binding to discrete protein motifs such as 14 3 3 domains , SH2 domains , and PDZ domains . Such changes may include the degree of solvent exposure, the frequency of collisional quenching, and the emergence of local electrostatic fields.The desalting columns were preequilibrated with TBS buffer (pH 7.4). The following procedure was performed on each of seven cysteine mutants of calmodulin (E11C, S38C, M76C, E87C, N111C, E114C, and M145C) as well as the wild type, which served as a control to determine whether any of the labeling agents exhibited non specific labeling under the selected reaction conditions. The eluted fractions containing the labeled proteins were then quantified using the Bio Rad protein assay where a stock solution of wild type calmodulin of predetermined concentration was used to generate the standard curve.In this study, the 4 DMN derivatives 1 4 were evaluated and compared with five other well established solvatochromic fluorophores to address a number of critical factors pertaining to the successful application of such tools in detecting specific types of bimolecular interactions. Because the 4 DMN derivatives possess such low intrinsic fluorescence in water, these effects are significantly less consequential . Due to the rarity in which solvatochromic fluorophores exhibit the maximum potential fluorescence changes when used in many biological applications, the large intrinsic fluorescence exhibited by many of these probes in aqueous environments represents a critical issue that can ultimately be limiting.","While these efforts have proved highly successful, our current aim has been to expand the scope of applications to include the integration of these tools into native proteins.

The eluted fractions containing the labeled proteins were then quantified using the Bio Rad protein assay where a stock solution of wild type calmodulin of predetermined concentration was used to generate the standard curve.In this study, the 4 DMN derivatives 1 4 were evaluated and compared with five other well established solvatochromic fluorophores to address a number of critical factors pertaining to the successful application of such tools in detecting specific types of bimolecular interactions. Because the 4 DMN derivatives possess such low intrinsic fluorescence in water, these effects are significantly less consequential . Due to the rarity in which solvatochromic fluorophores exhibit the maximum potential fluorescence changes when used in many biological applications, the large intrinsic fluorescence exhibited by many of these probes in aqueous environments represents a critical issue that can ultimately be limiting.",0.4104803493449782,0.10526315789473685,0.23968201296099004,0.4104803493449782,0.10526315789473685,0.23968201296099004

244,"introduction and objectives the impact of risk factors upon perioperative mortality might differ for patients undergoing open versus endovascular repair (evar) of abdominal aortic aneurysms (aaa). in order to investigate this, we developed a differential predictive model of perioperative mortality after aaa repair. methods a total of 45,660 propensity score matched medicare beneficiaries undergoing elective open or endovascular aaa repair from were studied. using half the dataset we developed a multiple logistic regression model for a matched cohort of open and evar patients and used this to derive an easily evaluable risk prediction score. the remainder of the dataset formed a validation cohort used to confirm results. results the derivation cohort included 11,415 open and 11,415 endovascular repairs. perioperative mortality was 5.3% and 1.8% respectively. independent predictors of mortality (rr, 95% ci) were open repair (3.2, 2.73.8), age (7175 years 1.2, 0.91.6; years 1.9, 1.42.5; >80 years 3.1, 2.44.2), female sex (1.5, 1.31.8), dialysis (2.6, 1.54.6), chronic renal insufficiency (2.0, 1.62.6), congestive heart failure (1.7, 1.52.1), and vascular disease (1.3, 1.21.6). there were no differential predictors of mortality across the two procedures. a simple scoring system was developed from a logistic regression model fit to both endovascular and open patients (area under the roc curve of 72.6) from which low, medium, and high risk groups were developed. the absolute predicted mortality ranged from 0.7% for an evar patient years of age with no comorbidities to 38% for an open patient > with all the comorbidities considered. although relative risk was similar among age groups, the absolute difference was greater for older patients (with higher baseline risk). conclusions mortality after aaa repair is predicted by comorbidities, sex, and age and these predictors have similar effects for both methods of aaa repair. this simple scoring system can predict repair mortality for both treatment options and thus may help guide clinical decisions.","Follow up monitoring regimens, however, are more intensive after endovascular repair, and aneurysm related re interventions are more frequent. Thus, the decision to pursue open versus endovascular repair hinges on many factors and is not always straightforward . Using comprehensive data on elderly enrollees in the Medicare program, we previously found that in hospital mortality for endovascular AAA repair and open repair were 1.2% and 4.8% respectively, but that early mortality differences increased with age.there were no differential predictors of mortality across the two procedures. Overall perioperative mortality over the study period was 1.8% (95% CI 1.52.0) after EVAR and 5.3% (95% CI 4.95.7) after open repair. this simple scoring system can predict repair mortality for both treatment options and thus may help guide clinical decisions.Given a higher baseline mortality of open repair, absolute mortality increases as more risk factors are added, making the absolute benefit of EVAR greater. Baseline beneficiary demographic characteristics were obtained from the Medicare denominator file.

246,"summary mechanically damaged plasma membrane undergoes rapid calcium dependent resealing that appears to depend, at least in part, on calpain mediated cortical cytoskeletal remodeling. cells null for capns1, the non catalytic small subunit present in both m and calpains, do not undergo calcium mediated resealing. however, it is not known which of these calpains is needed for repair, or whether other major cytosolic proteinases may participate. utilizing isozyme selective sirnas to decrease expression of capn1 or capn2, catalytic subunits of and m calpains, respectively, in a mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line, we now show that substantial loss of both activities is required to compromise calcium mediated survival after cell scrape damage. using skeletal myotubes derived from capn3null mice, we were unable to demonstrate loss of sarcolemma resealing after needle scratch or laser damage. isolated muscle fibers from capn3 knockout mice also efficiently repaired laser damage. employing either a cell line expressing a temperature sensitive e1 ubiquitin ligase, or lactacystin, a specific proteasome inhibitor, it was not possible to demonstrate an effect of the proteasome on calcium mediated survival after injury. moreover, several cell permeant caspase inhibitors were incapable of significantly decreasing survival or inhibiting membrane repair. taken together with previous studies, the results show that m or calpain can facilitate repair of damaged plasma membrane. while there was no evidence for the involvement of calpain 3, the proteasome or caspases in early events of plasma membrane repair, our studies do not rule out their participation in downstream events that may link plasma membrane repair to adaptive remodeling after injury.","There it fuses with the ruptured plasma membrane to quickly restore the permeability barrier that all living cells require .

However, it is clear that the co infusion of two umbilical cord blood units extends the application of transplant in general to nearly all patients. Furthermore, umbilical cord blood is rapidly available, it now has a high rate of engraftment with improved cytoreductive therapies and higher thresholds for cell dose, and it is generally associated with a low risk of grade 3 or 4 acute graft vs host disease and extensive chronic graft vs host disease.",0.4236453201970444,0.16831683168316833,0.24920082832936263,0.4236453201970444,0.16831683168316833,0.24920082832936263
250,"purpose interferon regulatory factor (irf6) encodes a member of the irf family of transcription factors. mutations in irf6 cause van der woude (vws) and popliteal pterygium syndromes (pps), two related orofacial clefting disorders. here, we compared and contrasted the frequency and distribution of exonic mutations in irf6 between two large geographically distinct collections of families with vws and between one collection of families with pps. methods we performed direct sequence analysis of irf6 exons on samples from three collections, two with vws and one with pps. results we identified mutations in irf6 exons in 68% of families in both vws collections and in 97% of families with pps. in sum, novel disease causing variants were found. the distribution of mutations in the irf6 exons in each collection was not random; exons 3, 4, 7, and accounted for 80%. in the vws collections, the mutations were evenly divided between protein truncation and missense, whereas most mutations identified in the pps collection were missense. further, the missense mutations associated with pps were localized significantly to exon 4, at residues that are predicted to bind directly to dna. conclusion the non random distribution of mutations in the irf6 exons suggests a two tier approach for efficient mutation screens for irf6. the type and distribution of mutations are consistent with the hypothesis that vws is caused by haploinsufficiency of irf6. on the other hand, the distribution of pps associated mutations suggests a different, though not mutually exclusive, effect on irf6 function.","The type and distribution in location of PPS mutations differ significantly from the VWS mutations, but are not mutually exclusive.

251,"genome wide association studies (gwas) require considerable investment, so researchers often study multiple traits collected on the same set of subjects to maximize return. however, many gwas have adopted a case control design; improperly accounting for case control ascertainment can lead to biased estimates of association between markers and secondary traits. we show that under the null hypothesis of no marker secondary trait association, nave analyses that ignore ascertainment or stratify on case control status have proper type i error rates except when both the marker and secondary trait are independently associated with disease risk. under the alternative hypothesis, these methods are unbiased when the secondary trait is not associated with disease risk. we also show that inverse probability of sampling weighted (ipw) regression provides unbiased estimates of marker secondary trait association. we use simulation to quantify the type i error, power and bias of nave and ipw methods. ipw regression has appropriate type i error in all situations we consider, but has lower power than nave analyses. the bias for nave analyses is small provided the marker is independent of disease risk. considering the majority of tested markers in a gwas are not associated with disease risk, nave analyses provide valid tests of and nearly unbiased estimates of marker secondary trait association. care must be taken when there is evidence that both the secondary trait and tested marker are associated with the primary disease, a situation we illustrate using an analysis of the relationship between a marker in fgfr2 and mammographic density in a breast cancer case control sample.","For example, recent GWAS for height [; ; ] and body mass index were conducted using samples from multiple GWAS which were originally conducted to find markers associated with risk of diabetes, breast and prostate cancers, and other traits.

Although our discussion of IPW regression has been rather heuristic, we note that the procedure (and corresponding variance corrections) can be placed on solid theoretical grounds by considering the case control study as a two stage design [; ] or missing data problem [; ; ] .Further work is necessary to examine the degree of bias induced using incorrect sampling fractions, or developing more efficient, unbiased methods. There is no need to restrict analysis to controls to preserve test validity or remove biaswhich is encouraging, as restricting to controls greatly reduces sample size and power .

255,"startle reflex modulation by affective pictures is a well established effect in human emotion research. however, much less is known about startle modulation by affective faces, despite the growing evidence that facial expressions robustly activate emotion related brain circuits. in this study, acoustic startle probes were administered to young adult participants (16 women) during the viewing of slides from the pictures of facial affect set including neutral, happy, angry, and fearful faces. the effect of expression valence (happy, neutral, negative) on startle magnitude was highly significant (p<.001). startle reflex was strongly potentiated by negative expressions (fearful and angry), however, no attenuation by happy faces was observed. a significant valence by gender interaction suggests stronger startle potentiation effects in females. these results demonstrate that affective facial expressions can produce significant modulation of the startle reflex.","Moreover, facial stimuli also produced a greater autonomic (skin conductance) response than affective pictures in the same study. The neural mechanisms of face perception are being increasingly understood (reviewed in ; ). These studies showed that the primary acoustic startle pathway in the brain stem is modulated through direct projections by the secondary pathway, in which the amygdala plays the central role.The average serial position of the positive, neutral, and negative expressions was 25.7, 23.7, and 22.2 (differences were non significant: F(2,34)=.31, p=.74; all pairwise comparisons: p>.8) .

258,"the lateral cilia of the gill of crassostrea virginica are controlled by a dopaminergicserotonergic innervation. dopamine is the neurotransmitter causing cilio inhibition. high levels of manganese are neurotoxic to people, causing manganism, a parkinson like disease. clinical interventions for manganism have not been very successful. recently, p aminosalicylic acid (pas) was reported as an effective treatment of severe manganism in humans; however, its mechanism of action is unknown. previously, we reported that manganese treatments caused disruption of the dopaminergic innervation of gill of c. virginica. here we compared the effects of manganese on gill innervation in the presence of pas, edta or acetylsalicylic acid (asa), and examined whether co treating animals with pas could block the deleterious effects of manganese on the oyster's dopaminergic innervation of the gill. beating rates of the lateral cilia of the gill were measured by stroboscopic microscopy. pre treating gill preparations with pas or edta blocked the neurotoxic effects of manganese, while asa did not. in other experiments, animals exposed to three day treatments with manganese produced a dose dependent impairment of the dopaminergic, cilio inhibitory system, which was decreased by co treatment with pas. the study shows that pas protects the animal against neurotoxic effects of manganese and the mechanism of action of pas in alleviating manganism is more likely related to its chelating abilities than its anti inflammatory actions.","The innervation originates in the cerebral and visceral ganglia, and controls the gill via the branchial nerve.

260,"bath applied membrane permeant ca2+ indicators offer access to network function with single cell resolution. a barrier to wider and more efficient use of this technique is the difficulty of extracting fluorescence signals from the active constituents of the network under study. here we present a method for semi automatic region of interest (roi) detection that exploits the spatially compact, slowly time varying character of the somatic signals that these indicators typically produce. first, the image series is differenced to eliminate static and very slowly varying fluorescence values, and then the differenced image series undergoes low pass filtering in the spatial domain, to eliminate temporally isolated fluctuations in brightness. this processed image series is then thresholded so that pixel regions of fluctuating brightness are set to white, while all other regions are set to black. binary images are averaged, and then subjected to iterative thresholding to extract rois associated with both dim and bright cells. the original image series is then analyzed using the generated rois, after which the end user rejects spurious signals. these methods are applied to respiratory networks in the neonate rat tilted sagittal slab preparation, and to simulations with signal to noise ratios ranging between 1.0 0.2. simulations established that algorithm performance degraded gracefully with increasing noise. because signal extraction is the necessary first step in the analysis of time varying ca2+ signals, semi automated roi detection frees the researcher to focus on the next step: selecting traces of interest from the relatively complete set generated using these methods.","The disadvantages of this approach are: it is time consuming; it is difficult to tightly fit the ROI to the area from which optical signal is to be extracted, and it is prone to produce different results depending on who does the analysis . Manual analysis becomes still more difficult as sampling rate increases via the use of sensitive but noisy electron multiplier CCDs, and/or binning of CCD elements, which lowers spatial resolution. Optical recording of neuronal activity has been in use for a generation now, starting with voltage sensitive dyes , Ca2+ indicators (Grynkiewicz, Poenie et al. 1985), and more recently genetically encoded fluorescent sensors .In this image, fluorescence changes during Ca2+ influx are more salient, pixels within bright regions are still quite variable, with active regions showing up as going towards white (during Ca2+ influx) or towards black after return to baseline (arrows). A. anatomical location of recording overlaps with the preBtC, which has been identified as lying 500 m caudal to the VIIn . Because of space constraints F/F scale bars have been omitted.Using fewer thresholds or changing the spatial averaging would likely lead to fewer ROIs, raising the probability of type 2 error . This discrepancy may be due to the fact that the two bursts in the sparse dataset both reached the maximum amplitude (0.5), whereas in the rhythmic simulation, only one of the peaks reached this amplitude, while the other 32 peaks were smaller. Cell permeant AM ester dyes load not only neurons of interest, but also other neurons and glia, which were correctly identified by the algorithm.","The disadvantages of this approach are: it is time consuming; it is difficult to tightly fit the ROI to the area from which optical signal is to be extracted, and it is prone to produce different results depending on who does the analysis .

262,"the power of fmri in assessing neural activities is hampered by inter subject variations in basal physiologic parameters, which may not be related to neural activation but has a modulatory effect on fmri signals. therefore, normalization of fmri signals with these parameters is useful in reducing variations and improving sensitivity of this important technique. recently, we have shown that basal venous oxygenation is a significant modulator of fmri signals and individuals with higher venous oxygenation tend to have lower fmri signals. in this study, we aim to test the utility of venous oxygenation normalization in distinguishing subject groups. a model condition was used in which two visual stimuli with different flashing frequencies were used to stimulate two subject groups, respectively, thereby simulating the situation of control and patient groups. it was found that visual evoked bold signal is significantly correlated with baseline venous t2 (p=0.0003) and inclusion of physiologic modulator in the regression analysis can substantially reduce p values of group level statistical tests. when applied to voxel wise analysis, the normalization process can allow the detection of more significant voxels. the utility of other basal parameters, including blood pressure, heart rate, arterial oxygenation and end tidal co2, in bold normalization was also assessed and it was found that the improvement was less significant. time to peak of the bold responses was also studied and it was found that subjects with higher basal venous oxygenation tend to have slower bold responses.","Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies often require the use of multiple subjects, in which fMRI data from a group of participants are processed together to yield a population activation result .

Reasons for discrepancies in results include lack of a consistent definition of weight loss maintenance, differences in activity assessments, differences in study design, short follow up, small sample size, lack of adjustment for potential confounders, and lack of adjustments for baseline body weight .Approximately 4% in 1991 and 9% in 1995 of these covariates had missing values; therefore an indicator variable for missing responses was created. Our weight loss maintenance definition required a weight regain in the 6 year period not exceeding 30% of prior weight loss or 1.5% of prior original weight in 1989. Because some components of diet have been observed to be predictive of weight gain , they were included in the analysis.Active women had a lower BMI at baseline, consumed more fiber, and less trans fat and sugar sweetened beverages. The highest (>60 min/d) and the lowest (010 min/d) categories in 1991 were cross classified with the five 1997 categories, which yielded 10 groups.

264,"detailed comparisons of hiv drug resistance assays are needed to identify the most useful assays for research studies, and to facilitate comparison of results from studies that use different methods. we analyzed nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (nnrti) resistance in hiv infected ugandan infants who had received nevirapine (nvp) based prophylaxis using the following assays: an fda cleared hiv genotyping assay (the viroseq hiv 1 genotyping system v2.0), a commercially available hiv genotyping assay (geneseq hiv), a commercially available hiv phenotyping assay (phenosense hiv), and a sensitive point mutation assay (ligamp). viroseq and geneseq hiv results (nvp resistance yes/no) were similar for (95%) of samples. in (15%) of samples, geneseq hiv detected mutations in minor subpopulations that were not detected by viroseq, which identified two additional infants with nvp resistance. ligamp detected low level mutations in samples that were not detected by viroseq; however, ligamp testing identified only one additional infant with nvp resistance. geneseq hiv and phenosense hiv determinations of susceptibility differed for specific nnrtis in (31%) of the samples containing mixtures at relevant mutation positions. phenosense hiv did not detect any infants with nvp resistance who were not identified with geneseq hiv testing. in this setting, population sequencing based methods (viroseq and geneseq hiv) were the most informative and had concordant results for 95% of the samples. ligamp was useful for the detection and quantification of minority variants. phenosense hiv provided a direct and quantitative measure of nnrti susceptibility.","Recent studies in adults suggest that the presence of minority variants may be associated with a poor response to subsequent antiretroviral therapy. Cost and other factors limit the availability of resistance testing in resource limited settings. Phenotypic assays do provide quantitative information about drug susceptibility without requiring knowledge of resistance mutations, and in some cases, may reveal unexpected reductions in susceptibility in the absence of known resistance mutations.The LigAmp assay includes a mutation specific oligonucleotide ligation step followed by a universal real time PCR detection step. Thirty (67%) of the 45 mutations were detected by both ViroSeq and LigAmp. The 12 mutations detected by LigAmp only were present at very low levels (median: 1.65%, range: 0.75.9%, ).Assay discordance between ViroSeq and Gene Seq could reflect test to test variability. In most perinatal studies, the volume of infant plasma available for analysis is limited, and assay procedures must often be adapted for low volume samples. HIV subtypes determined with the GeneSeq HIV assay matched the HIV subtypes obtained by phylogenetic analysis of pol region sequences generated with the ViroSeq system (see Materials and Methods).","Recent studies in adults suggest that the presence of minority variants may be associated with a poor response to subsequent antiretroviral therapy.

265,"acidocalcisomes are acidic organelles with a high concentration of phosphorus present as pyrophosphate (ppi) and polyphosphate (poly p) complexed with calcium, and other cations. the acidocalcisome membrane contains a number of pumps (ca2+ atpase, v h+ atpase, h+ ppase), exchangers (na+/h+, ca2+/h+), and channels (aquaporins), while its matrix contains enzymes related to ppi and poly p metabolism. acidocalcisomes have been observed in pathogenic, as well as non pathogenic prokaryotes and eukaryotes e.g. chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and dictyostelium discoideum. some of the potential functions of the acidocalcisome are the storage of cations and phosphorus, the participation of phosphorus in ppi and poly p metabolism, calcium homeostasis, maintenance of intracellular ph homeostasis, and osmoregulation. in addition, acidocalcisomes resemble lysosome related organelles (lro) from mammalian cells in many of their properties. for example, we found that platelet dense granules, which are lros, are very similar to acidocalcisomes. they share a similar size, acidic properties, and both contain ppi, poly p and calcium. recent work that indicates that they also share the system for targeting of their membrane proteins through adaptor protein (ap 3) reinforces this concept. the fact that acidocalcisomes interact with other organelles in parasitic protists, e.g. the contractile vacuole in trypanosoma cruzi, and other vacuoles observed in toxoplasma gondii, suggests that these cellular compartments may be associated with the endosomal/lysosomal pathway.","ACIDOCALCISOMES are acidic calcium storage organelles found in a diverse range of organisms, including trypanosomes in which they were first defined . Beginning as early as 1895, acidic calcium storage organelles have been variously defined as metachromatic granules , volutin granules or polyphosphate bodies .

266,"second harmonic generation (shg) imaging is combined with coherent anti stokes raman scattering (cars) microscopy to follow the process of optical clearing in human skin ex vivo using dimethyl sulfoxide (dmso) as the optical clearing agent. shg imaging revealed that dmso introduces morphological changes to the collagen i matrix. by carefully measuring the dynamic tissue attenuation of the coherent nonlinear signal, using cars reference signals during the clearing process, it is found that dmso reduces the overall shg response from dermal collagen. evidence is provided for a role of dmso in compromising the structure of collagen fibers, associated with a reduction of the tissues scattering properties.","In this study, we combine SHG imaging of dermal collagen with simultaneous coherent anti Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) measurements of the local OCA concentration. Not surprisingly, the temporary reduction of scattering observed after tissue immersion in select nonreactive chemical agents has drawn the attention of biomedical microscopists. Like glycerol, DMSO exhibits a high optical clearing potential .Similar signatures have been observed in skin in situ treated with glycerol . The frequency difference between the pump and the Stokes radiation was set to 2913 cm1, corresponding to the symmetric CH3 vibration of DMSO. In addition, the 812.2 nm radiation also served as the driving beam for the SHG process.By detecting both the F CARS and E CARS signals, we were able to extract two hitherto elusive parameters during the clearing process: (1) the time dependent attenuation coefficient for the coherent nonlinear signal and (2) the local concentration of the OCA. These combined observations emphasize that both the mechanism of refractive index matching and the structural changes of collagen I fibers play an important role in reducing the scattering properties during skin optical clearing . Our measurements suggest that DMSO interferes with the highly organized structure of thick collagen fibers, possibly by changing the interfibril spacing on a sub m scale.","In this study, we combine SHG imaging of dermal collagen with simultaneous coherent anti Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) measurements of the local OCA concentration.

267,"applying localized external displacement to the breast surface can change the interstitial fluid pressure such that regional transient microvascular changes occur in oxygenation and vascular volume. imaging these dynamic responses over time, while different pressures are applied, could provide selective temporal contrast for cancer relative to the surrounding normal breast. in order to investigate this possibility in normal breast tissue, a near infrared spectral tomography system was developed that can simultaneously acquire data at three wavelengths with a s time resolution per scan. the system was tested first with heterogeneous blood phantoms. changes in regional blood concentrations were found to be linearly related to recovered mean hemoglobin concentration (hbt) values (r2 = 0.9). in a series of volunteer breast imaging exams, data from asymptomatic subjects were acquired under increasing and decreasing breast compression. calculations show that a mm displacement applied to the breast results in surface pressures in the range of kpa depending on breast density. the recovered human data indicate that hbt was reduced under compression and the normalized change was significantly correlated to the applied pressure with a p value of 0.005. the maximum hbt decreases in breast tissue were associated with body mass index (bmi), which is a surrogate indicator of breast density. no statistically valid correlations were found between the applied pressure and the changes in tissue oxygen saturation (sto2) or water percentage (h2o) across the range of bmi values studied.","IFP is significantly higher in tumors than in surrounding normal tissues . Full spectral tomography with more than two wavelengths at a frame rate of several seconds has not been previously demonstrated, even though it is technologically feasible, because the clinical benefits of imaging these changes are not yet apparent . Localized physiological properties such as total hemoglobin concentration (HbT), tissue oxygen saturation (StO2), and water percentage (H2O) can be quantified diagnostically in breast with NIR imaging systems .To validate the values of HbT, StO2, and H2O recovered by the system, a series of phantoms with well characterized properties were used.

268,"frequency domain near infrared (nir) diffuse spectral tomography with a mode locked ti:sapphire laser is presented, providing tunable multiwavelength quantitative spectroscopy with maximal power for thick tissue imaging. the system was developed to show that intrinsically high stability can be achieved with many wavelengths in the nir range, using a mode locked signal of mhz with heterodyned lock in detection. the effect of cumulative noise from multiple wavelengths of data on the reconstruction process was studied, and it was shown that inclusion of more wavelengths can reduce skew in the noise distribution. this normalization of the data variance then minimizes errors in estimation of chromophore concentrations. simulations and tissue phantom experiments were used to quantify this improvement in image accuracy for recovery of tissue hemoglobin and oxygen saturation.","The system signal amplitude and phase noise are systematically compared with that produced with diode lasers over the full photomultiplier tube (PMT) detection band. In our previous work, a systematic simulation study showed that including more wavelengths of data could improve the recovery of chromophore concentrations and scattering properties . Incorporating spectral constraints into the image formation problem can enhance the accuracy of NIR tomographic spectroscopy , especially when additional wavelengths are added.The gelatin phantom was composed of porcine gelatin (Sigma Aldrich G2500), TiO2 powder (Sigma Aldrich T8141), porcine blood, and saline. The difficulty in obtaining accurate quantification comes from the ill posed nature of diffuse optical tomography reconstruction. A chemical microsensor (Diamond general development corporation, Ann Arbor, Michigan) showed that the StO2 was around 50% during measurement.The intrinsic signal from the laser was used for lock in detection.

270,"bacteriophage t4 and t7 are well studied model replication systems, which have allowed researchers to determine the roles of many proteins central to dna replication, recombination, and repair. here we discuss the results from two recently developed single molecule methods to determine the salt dependent dna binding kinetics and thermodynamics of the single stranded dna (ssdna) binding proteins (ssbs) from these systems. we use these methods to characterize both the equilibrium double stranded dna (dsdna) and ssdna binding of the ssbs t4 gene protein (gp32) and t7 gene 2.5 protein (gp2.5). despite the overall two order of magnitude weaker binding of gp2.5 to both forms of dna, we find that both proteins exhibit four orders of magnitude preferential binding to ssdna relative to dsdna. this strong preferential ssdna binding as well as the weak dsdna binding are essential for the ability of both proteins to search dsdna in one dimension to find available ssdna binding sites at the replication fork.","The last decade has seen rapid development in single molecule force spectroscopy.

271,"background studies using transthoracic thermodilution have demonstrated increased extravascular lung water (evlw) measurements attributed to progression of edema and flooding during sepsis and acute lung injury. we hypothesize that redistribution of pulmonary blood flow can cause increased apparent evlw secondary to increased perfusion of thermally silent tissue, not increased lung edema. methods anesthetized, mechanically ventilated canines were instrumented with picco (pulsion medical, munich, germany) catheters and underwent lung injury by repetitive saline lavage. hemodynamic and respiratory physiologic data were recorded. after stabilized lung injury, endotoxin was administered to inactivate hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. computerized tomographic imaging was performed to quantify in vivo lung volume, total tissue (fluid) and air content, and regional distribution of blood flow. results lavage injury caused an increase in airway pressures and decreased arterial oxygen content with minimal hemodynamic effects. evlw and shunt fraction increased after injury and then markedly following endotoxin administration. computerized tomographic measurements quantified an endotoxin induced increase in pulmonary blood flow to poorly aerated regions with no change in total lung tissue volume. conclusions the abrupt increase in evlw and shunt fraction after endotoxin administration is consistent with inactivation of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and increased perfusion to already flooded lung regions that were previously thermally silent. computerized tomographic studies further demonstrate in vivo alterations in regional blood flow (but not lung water) and account for these alterations in shunt fraction and evlw.","HPV causes pulmonary arterial vessels to constrict in response to local hypoxia, redistributing blood flow away from poorly ventilated regions and toward lung regions that are well ventilated, optimizing local ventilation/perfusion matching and minimizing shunt fraction (Qs/Qt). Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) is a fundamental homeostatic mechanism by which the lung preserves oxygenation during injury. Functional lung imaging using high resolution computerized tomography (CT) has the capability to evaluate regional pulmonary blood flow and ventilation, in addition to providing high resolution information on aeration and anatomy, including the assessment of lung edema.Saline lavage lung injury was induced by repetitive tracheal instillation of warmed saline (60 mL/kg) with gravity drainage to achieve a Qs/Qt >20% and PaO2/FiO2 300. This effect has been indirectly demonstrated in experimental models altering perfusion by PA occlusion,, embolization, vasodilators, PEEP,,, and bronchial obstruction. Repeated perfusion studies at additional locations could reduce this sampling error, but the additional contrast load eventually affects the ability to quantitate lung density.However, we did not exclude any subjects from the analysis as we feel this illustrates the variability in regional blood flow that underlies our hypothesis .

This effect has been indirectly demonstrated in experimental models altering perfusion by PA occlusion,, embolization, vasodilators, PEEP,,, and bronchial obstruction. Repeated perfusion studies at additional locations could reduce this sampling error, but the additional contrast load eventually affects the ability to quantitate lung density.However, we did not exclude any subjects from the analysis as we feel this illustrates the variability in regional blood flow that underlies our hypothesis . Redistribution of pulmonary blood flow impacts thermodilution based extravascular lung water measurements in a model of acute lung injury None Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and mean PA blood pressure comparisons, however, were based on the first 5 animals since the PA catheter was removed in animals undergoing CT imaging.",0.42217484008528783,0.1070663811563169,0.20493725928476533,0.42217484008528783,0.1070663811563169,0.20493725928476533
272,"a hemispherical focused, ultrasound phased array was designed and fabricated using cylindrical piezoelectric transducers that utilize lateral coupling for noninvasive transcranial therapy. the cylindrical transducers allowed the electrical impedance to be reduced by at least an order of magnitude, such that effective operation could be achieved without electronic matching circuits. in addition, the transducer elements generated the maximum acoustic average surface intensity of w/cm2. the array, driven at the low (306 khz) or high frequency (840 khz), achieved excellent focusing through an ex vivo human skull and an adequate beam steering range for clinical brain treatments. it could electronically steer the ultrasound beam over cylindrical volumes of mm in diameter and mm in height at khz, and 30 mm in diameter and 30 mm in height at khz. a scanning laser vibrometer was used to investigate the radial and length mode vibrations of the element. the maximum pressure amplitudes through the skull at the geometric focus were predicted to be 5.5 mpa at khz and 3.7 mpa at khz for rf power of w on each element. this is the first study demonstrating the feasibility of using cylindrical transducer elements and lateral coupling in construction of ultrasound phased arrays.","In addition, ultrasound attenuation in brain tissue is reduced, increasing the possibility of reflections and standing waves which may cause tissue damage outside the focal volume. The array was constructed using a new transducer manufacturing method that allows reduction of the electrical impedance of a transducer element . These include targeted drug delivery , tumor tissue ablation , gene therapy , and local blood brain barrier (BBB) opening [ ].The array elements were rigidly mounted on the cork rubber using an epoxy (301 2, Epoxy Technology, Billerica, MA, USA). The overall electrical to acoustic power conversion efficiency of the element was obtained by using the radiation force measurement technique and scanning laser vibrometer . Therefore, the wave propagation and mechanical crosstalk in the Lucite dome were reduced to avoid any significant mechanical interference during sonication.Phase correction was performed on the computer ( in ) for all array elements and study experiments to eliminate any system induced phase delay and ensure the best possible focusing . The primary goal of phase correction is to allow the radiating acoustic waveforms from each element to arrive at desired foci in phase. The experimental setup shown in was used to measure the phase aberration in response to a continuous sinusoidal signal with a known frequency and phase delay.","In addition, ultrasound attenuation in brain tissue is reduced, increasing the possibility of reflections and standing waves which may cause tissue damage outside the focal volume.

273,"this work describes the extension of a previously reported empirical localized orbital correction model for density functional theory (dft loc) for atomization energies, ionization potentials, electron affinities, and reaction enthalpies to the correction of barrier heights for chemical reactions of various types including cycloadditions, cycloreversions, dipolar cycloadditions, sn2s, carbon radical reactions, hydrogen radical reactions, sigmatropic shifts, and electrocyclizations. the b3lyp localized orbital correction version of the model (b3lyp loc) reduces the number of outliers and overall mean unsigned error (mue) vs. experiment or ab initio values from 3.2 to 1.3 kcal/mole for barrier heights and from 5.1 to 1.1 kcal/mole for reaction enthalpies versus b3lyp. furthermore, the new model has essentially zero additional computational cost beyond standard dft calculations. although the model is heuristic and is based on multiple linear regression to experimental or ab initio data, each of the parameters is justified on chemical grounds and provides insight into the fundamental limitations of dft, most importantly the failure of current dft methods to accurately account for nondynamical electron correlation.",". Specialized parameters for unusual groups, such as azides, would in fact improve the results, but we have avoided this because we do not believe there is sufficient or diverse enough data to avoid the danger of over fitting for such cases. These parameters can eventually even be deployed to treat dispersion, an area in which B3LYP is known to perform poorly.As more data becomes available (via either experiments or calculations), increases in the number of parameters can be considered . The parameters from the IP/EA model are used in the present work without any modification. The specific implementation of these parameters is discussed in sections II.D.2 and II.D.3 for enthalpies of ionic reactions and in sections III.B and III.C for barrier heights of ionic reactions.The ratio of adjustable parameters to new data points (105) is reasonable, and the parameters obtained from fitting are physically consistent with previously developed B3LYP LOC parameters for ground state thermochemistry . Further, it should ultimately be possible to extend this methodology to excited states . The results discussed above confirm that the core B3LYP LOC approach provides high accuracy results for enthalpies of reaction, and introduce for the first time a viable model for obtaining barrier heights with this methodology.",".

274,"objective our aim was to characterize the changes in mrna abundance, protein, and activity levels of the enzymatic antioxidants, superoxide dismutase (sod), glutathione peroxidase (gpx), and catalase by exercise training combined with l arginine after myocardial infarction (mi). methods l arginine (1g/kg/day) and ng nitro l arginine methyl ester (l name, mg/kg/day) were administered in drinking water for weeks. sprague dawley rats were randomized to the following groups: sham operated control (sham); mi sedentary (sed); mi exercise (ex); mi sedentary+l arginine (sed+la); mi exercise+l arginine (ex+la); mi sedentary+l name (sed+l name); and mi exercise+l name (ex+l name). results the gpx, catalase and gp91phox mrna levels were comparable among all the groups. the sod mrna level was significantly increased in the ex group (5.430.87) compared to the sed group (1.740.29), whereas this effect was pronouncedly down regulated by the l name intervention (2.511.17, p<0.05). the protein levels of sod in the sed and ex groups were both significantly decreased with the administration of l name. the protein levels of catalase were significantly higher in the ex and ex+la groups than in the sed, sed+la, and l name treated groups. the collagen volume fraction was significantly lowered by the exercise and/or l arginine treatment when compared to the sed group. fractional shortening was significantly preserved in the trained groups compared to their corresponding sedentary groups with or without drug treatments. however, the beneficial effect was not further improved by l arginine treatment. conclusions our results suggest that exercise training exerts antioxidative effects, and attenuates myocardial fibrosis in the mi rats. these improvements, in turn, alleviate cardiac stiffness, and preserve post mi cardiac function. in addition, l arginine appears to have no additive effect on cardiac function or expression of enzymatic antioxidants.","Living cells have both enzymatic and nonenzymatic defense mechanisms to balance a multitude of oxidative challenges.

275,"q sweat, a commercial quantitative sweat measurement system, is modeled on quantitative sudomotor axon reflex testing (qsart). the current study investigated the sweat response using q sweat and mayo qsart recordings under identical conditions in healthy normal controls. ninety four participants were recruited for this study. all participants underwent randomized bilateral qsart recordings over the four standard recording regions. for both men and women, wilcoxon signed rank tests of paired differences showed significantly lower volumes at each of the four sites for q sweat vs. mayo qsart. linear regression analysis was used to estimate the relationship between q sweat and mayo qsart volume measurements separately for men and women. although there was variability about the regression lines, these fitted models can be used to estimate the expected mayo qsart volume given an observed q sweat volume, although it is preferable to use the q sweat normative database directly. we hypothesize that the constant current generator used in conjunction with q sweat provides a less efficient iontophoresis of acetylcholine than the mayo constructed constant current stimulator and results in lower volumes.","The quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test (QSART) has been a routine postganglionic sudomotor function (HCFA 95923) clinical laboratory test of the Mayo Clinic since 1983.

280,"the influence of diabetes on brain glutamate (glu) uptake was studied in insulinopenic (streptozotocin (stz)) and insulin resistant (diet induced obesity (dio)) rat models of diabetes. in the stz study, adult male sprague dawley rats were treated with stz (65 mg/kg iv) or vehicle and studied weeks later. stz rats had elevated plasma levels of glucose, ketone bodies and branched chain amino acids; brain uptake of glu was very low in both stz and control rats, examined under conditions of normal and greatly elevated (by iv infusion) plasma glu concentrations. in the dio study, rats ingested a palatable, high energy diet for weeks, and were then divided into weight tertiles: rats in the heaviest tertile were designated dio, rats in lightest tertile diet resistant (dr), and rats in the intermediate tertile controls. dio and dr rats continued to consume the high energy diet for more weeks, while control rats were switched to standard rat chow. all rats were studied at weeks (subgroups were examined under conditions of normal or elevated plasma glu concentrations). dio rats ate more food and were heavier than dr or control rats, and had higher plasma leptin levels and insulin:glucose ratios. in all diet groups, the bbb showed very low glu penetration, and was unaffected by plasma glu concentration. brain glu uptake also did not differ among the diet groups. together, the results indicate that the bbb remains intact to the penetration of glu in two models of diabetes under the conditions examined.","GLU compartmentation in brain is thus an important physiological issue, because the presence of high amounts of GLU in the extracellular fluid (ECF) surrounding neurons can cause them to be overexcited, leading ultimately to their death ( ).

281,"functional connectivity (fc) reflects the coherence of spontaneous, low frequency fluctuations in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) data. we report a behavior based connectivity analysis (bbca) method, in which whole brain data are used to identify behaviorally relevant, intrinsic fc networks. nineteen younger adults (20 28 years) and healthy, older adults (63 78 years) were assessed with fmri and diffusion tensor imaging (dti). results indicated that fc involving a distributed network of brain regions, particularly the inferior frontal gyri, exhibited age related change in the correlation with perceptual motor speed (choice reaction time; rt). no relation between fc and rt was evident for younger adults, whereas older adults exhibited a significant age related slowing of perceptual motor speed, which was mediated by decreasing fc. older adults' fc values were in turn associated positively with white matter integrity (from dti) within the genu of the corpus callosum. the developed fc analysis illustrates the value of identifying connectivity by combining structural, functional, and behavioral data.","Neuroimaging research on age related changes in brain function has focused nearly exclusively on task related activation (, ). for example, reported that 74% of the variability of the BOLD response in the left sensorimotor cortex, associated with the force of a right button press, was also shared with intrinsic, spontaneous activity within the right sensorimotor cortex. These signal components, however, although not attributable to specific task or external stimuli, contain valuable information regarding brain activity.Our conclusions regarding white matter integrity are based on relatively low resolution, non isotropic DTI data.

282,"spina bifida, a neural tube closure defect (ntd) involving the posterior portion of what will ultimately give rise to the spinal cord, is one of the most common and serious birth defects. the etiology of spina bifida is thought to be multi factorial and involve multiple interacting genes and environmental factors. the causes of this congenital malformation remain largely unknown. however, several candidate genes for spina bifida have been identified in lower vertebrates, including the planar cell polarity (pcp) genes. we used data from a case control study conducted in california to evaluate the association between variation within several key pcp genes and the risk of spina bifida. the pcp genes included in this study were the human homologues of the xenopus genes flamingo, strabismus, prickle, dishevelled and scrib, two of the homologues of xenopus wnt genes, wnt5a and wnt11, and two of the homologues of xenopus frizzled, fzd3 and fzd6. none of the snps that were evaluated were significantly associated with spina bifida in any racial/ethnic group after correction for multiple testing. however, several snps in the prickle2 gene had unadjusted p value<0.01. in conclusion our results, though largely negative, suggest that the prickle2 gene may potentially modify the risk of spina bifida and deserves further investigation.","Among genetically modified mouse models of NTDs, four involve PCP pathway genes: Vangl2, Scrib1, Celsr1 and Dsh1/Dsh2 .

283,"a simple method is described for using principal component analysis (pca) to score rat sleep recordings as awake, rapid eye movement (rem) sleep, or non rem (nrem) sleep. pca was used to reduce the dimensionality of the features extracted from each epoch to three, and the projections were then graphed in a scatterplot where the clusters were visually apparent. the clusters were then directly manually selected, classifying the entire recording at once. the method was tested in a set of ten 24 hour rat sleep electroencephalogram (eeg) and electromyogram (emg) recordings. classifications by two human raters performing traditional epoch by epoch scoring were blindly compared with classifications by another two human raters using the new pca method. overall inter rater median percent agreements ranged between 93.7% and 94.9%. median cohens kappa coefficient ranged from 0.890 to 0.909. the pca method on average required about five minutes for classification of each 24 hour recording. the combination of good accuracy and reduced time compared to traditional sleep scoring suggests that the method may be useful for sleep research.","However, to our knowledge the idea of using these cluster plots to directly score the recording has not previously been demonstrated.

284,"a new magnetic electrochemical immunoassay has been developed as a tool for biomonitoring exposures to organophosphate (op) compounds, e. g. insecticides and chemical nerve agents through directly detecting op phosphorylated acetylcholinesterase (op ache). this immunoassay uniquely incorporates highly efficient magnetic separation with ultra sensitive square wave voltammetry (swv) analysis using quantum dots (qds) as labels. a pair of antibodies were utilized to achieve the specific recognition of op ache that was prepared using paraoxon as an op model agent. anti phosphoserine polyclonal antibodies (ab1) were anchored on amorphous magnetic particles (mps) preferably chosen to capture op ache from the sample matrixes through binding their phosphoserine moieties that were exposed through unfolding the protein adducts, which was validated by electrochemical examinations and enzyme linked immunosorbent assays. furthermore, anti human ache monoclonal antibodies (ab2) were labeled with cadmium source qds to selectively recognize the captured op ache, as characterized by transmission electron microscopy (tem). the subsequent electrochemical swv analysis of the cadmium component released by acid from the coupled qds was conducted on disposable screen printed electrodes (spes). experimental results indicated that the swv based immunoassays could yield a linear response over a broad concentration range of 0.3 ng/ml op ache in human plasma with a detection limit of 0.15 ng/ml. such a novel electrochemical immunoassay holds great promises as a simple, selective, sensitive, and field analysis tool for the effective bio monitoring and diagnosis of potential exposures to nerve agents and pesticides.","Therefore, exploring selective, sensitive and reliable alternative biomarkers is an important consideration for biomonitoring of OP exposures . , , OPs can stoichiometrically bind with ChE and inhibit the enzyme activity, at the same time, they are metabolized by organophosphorus hydrolase to form inactive phosphonic acids that are then renally excreted. Moreover, a blocking agent consisting of 3 % BSA and 1 % PEG was introduced for effective minimization of nonspecific adsorptions in the immunoassays.Furthermore, 50 L aliquot of samples with the desired concentrations was added into each well to be incubated for 1 h at 37 C, and plate washing was conducted for three times.

288,"antigen recognition through the interaction between the t cell receptor (tcr) and peptide presented by major histocompatibility complex (pmhc) is the first step in t cell mediated immune responses. how this interaction triggers tcr signaling that leads to t cell activation is still unclear. taking into account the mechanical stress exerted on the pmhc tcr interaction at the dynamic interface between t cells and antigen presenting cells (apcs), we propose the so called receptor deformation model of tcr triggering. in this model, tcr conformational change induced by mechanical forces initiates tcr signaling. the receptor deformation model, for the first time, explains all three aspects of the tcr triggering puzzle: mechanism, specificity, and sensitivity.","It is generally accepted that MHC molecules exist as monomers and the majority of peptides presented are irrelevant endogenous peptides. Membrane dissociation coupled with these events should exert significant mechanical stress on the pMHC TCR interaction . pMHC TCR interaction is therefore the molecular basis for immune recognition.In fact, there are no data supporting the existence of such a barrier. In addition, autonomous TCR signaling was not observed in immature or mature T cells from CD4 and CD8 double knockout mice . It is more likely that TCR and Lck encounter each other frequently on the plasma membrane, since both TCR and Lck are highly mobile at the single molecule level on unstimulated T cells, where both partially partition into lipid rafts .We propose that TCR triggering is intimately coupled with the motor system of T cells, which generates mechanical forces not only to help T cells find specific pMHCs through cell motility, but also to initiate TCR signaling through receptor deformation. The receptor deformation model of TCR triggering is consistent with the indispensable role of actin and myosin in TCR signaling [, ]. Although currently there is no direct experimental evidence supporting it, the receptor deformation model can be tested by taking advantage of exciting recent advances in computer simulation, AFM, and structural analysis using NMR and fluorescence based techniques.","It is generally accepted that MHC molecules exist as monomers and the majority of peptides presented are irrelevant endogenous peptides.

289,"introduction site selective imaging can provide significant insight into the mechanism of hiv associated neurological disease. the goal of this study was to evaluate the involvement of serotonergic transmission in hiv associated depression using [11c]dasb, a serotonin transporter (5 htt) specific radiopharmaceutical for positron emission tomography (pet). methods depressed hiv+ subjects (hiv d), nondepressed hiv+ subjects (hiv nd) and healthy controls (hc) underwent an mri scan and a [11c]dasb pet scan. the outcome measure was 5 htt binding potential normalized to nondisplaceable tissue radioligand (bpnd). results hiv nd subjects had lower mean regional 5 htt bpnd estimates across regions, compared to hc, while hiv d subjects demonstrated higher mean regional binding values than hiv nd subjects in most regions. prior to correction for the false discovery rate, hiv nd had significantly lower bpnd values compared to hc subjects in two regions (insula and anterior cingulate) and all hiv+ patients had significantly lower binding than hc in all regions except for the midbrain, thalamus and pons. after correction for the false discovery rate, only the insula showed significantly lower binding in hiv+ subjects compared to hc (p < 0.0045). despite a significant difference in the duration of illness between the hiv d and hiv nd groups, there was no definite correlation between the duration of illness and bpnd. conclusion lower [11c]dasb binding in hiv+ patients compared to hc may reflect serotonergic neuronal loss as a component of generalized hiv associated neurodegeneration. higher mean regional bpnd values in hiv d compared to hiv nd subjects could reflect increased density of 5 htt, leading to increased clearance of serotonin from the synapse, which could account, in part, for symptoms of depression. the lack of correlation between duration of illness and binding argues against these findings being the result of differential neurodegeneration only. our findings suggest a possible role for dysregulated serotonergic transmission in hiv associated depression.","Neuropsychiatric symptoms, including depression, are very common and well recognized in the setting of HIV infection (; ; ; ). Currently [11C]DASB represents the best option among radiopharmaceuticals for imaging 5 HTT . Also, untreated depression in HIV+ individuals can promote risk taking behavior leading to further spread of the disease .Exclusion criteria included a history of SSRI use within one year prior to entry, history of current or past opportunistic central nervous system (CNS) infection at the start of the study, history or concurrent clinical evidence of a psychotic disorder (e.g. schizophrenia), history of chronic neurological disorder such as multiple sclerosis or epilepsy or structural CNS abnormalities such as stroke or arteriovenous malformation, history of present or recent (within the last year prior to the study) drug dependence, including use of cocaine, methamphetamine, opiates, barbiturates, or alcohol. One way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction was applied to each region separately. Therefore, we considered this patient an outlier and excluded those BPND results from the final analysis .Considering the range of scores obtained using the SCL 90 test, we evaluated for possible correlation between scores (both general test scores and individual symptomatology scores) and BPND values in the three subject groups. The genetic explanation is attractive, due to the known genetic susceptibility component in depression .

290,"we present a refined alkane charge equilibration (cheq) force field, improving our previously reported cheq alkane force field[1] to better reproduce experimental hydration free energies. experimental hydration free energies of ethane, propane, butane, pentane, hexane, and heptane are reproduced to within 3.6% on average. we demonstrate that explicit polarization results in a shift in molecular dipole moment for water molecules associated with the alkane molecule. we also show that our new parameters do not have a significant effect on the alkane water interactions as measured by the radial distribution function (rdf).","Our previous studies have focused on refining the CHEQ hexane force field of Patel and Brooks for more accurate bulk property predictions of larger n alkanes and extending the CHEQ model for more accurate modeling of phospholipid bilayers. We consider polarizable models for alkanes (as has been done in the past by several groups) as it has been shown that incorporating such effects improves the prediction of alkane dielectric constants. Aliphatic groups are also widely present in organic and biological systems; therefore, accurate representations of alkanes and aliphatic groups are desirable towards the goal of efficient molecular modeling of such systems.It is clear from these profiles that the changes made to the model have virtually no effect on the solvation structure of the alkanes in water. We wish to ensure that increasing the accuracy of the free energies does not affect how accurately the alkane water interactions are captured. For all systems, we have calculated the RDFs for water oxygen to alkane carbons using both the original model and our revised model.While it is difficult to ascertain whether this is a favorable result, we believe that the current force fields are deficient in their treatment of the interactions between water and the nonpolar interior of the bilayer. The hydration free energy is important for modeling the interactions of water with aliphatic groups. The CHEQ force field can capture subtle polarization effects of a single alkane molecule on nearby waters as shown by water dipole moment distributions.","Our previous studies have focused on refining the CHEQ hexane force field of Patel and Brooks for more accurate bulk property predictions of larger n alkanes and extending the CHEQ model for more accurate modeling of phospholipid bilayers.

291,"background while poor premorbid functioning is associated with poorer outcomes in psychotic illnesses, little is known about whether it is also a risk factor for suicide attempts. objective the current study examined the association of premorbid functioning and suicide attempts in a county wide cohort of first admission inpatients. method data were derived from participants of the suffolk county mental health project (n=444) over the course of month follow up. premorbid functioning was estimated and categorized (good vs. poor/declining) using the premorbid adjustment scale (pas). results poorer premorbid functioning was significantly associated with increased likelihood of a suicide attempt prior to first psychiatric hospital admission. specifically, 33.0% of participants with poor/declining premorbid functioning had a history of suicide attempts compared to 23.5% with good premorbid functioning. among participants with a prior attempt (n=126), poor premorbid functioning was significantly associated with an increased likelihood of additional attempts during the four years after first hospitalization. conclusion identifying those with poor premorbid functioning and prior histories of attempts could help clinicians target high risk patients. thus, greater attention to persons with both risk factors may form the basis for early interventions aimed towards reducing the risk for subsequent suicide attempts.","However, not all individuals who commit suicide will have made prior attempts and not all suicide attempters go on to complete suicide. What is clear from this body of work is that people with schizophrenia who commit suicide represent a heterogeneous group with respect to their early backgrounds. Conceivably, differences in sample characteristics, especially age of onset, have contributed to the contradictory findings to date .All analyses were conducted using SPSS (version 15.0) . Hence the number of cases in the analysis declined with each successive life stage. Follow up data were available for respondents who had full interviews on at least one of these post baseline time points .Consequently, more careful attention to suicide risk among persons with poor premorbid functioning is warranted. Early identification of persons with histories of attempts and poor premorbid functioning could enhance existing therapeutic services when treatment is first started. The findings suggest that premorbid functioning may have prognostic value across the sexes and among different diagnoses.","However, not all individuals who commit suicide will have made prior attempts and not all suicide attempters go on to complete suicide.

299,"the effects of pore size on the performance of ultrafiltration membranes are fairly well understood, but there is currently no information on the impact of pore geometry on the trade off between the selectivity and permeability for membranes with pore size below nm. experimental data are presented for both commercial ultrafiltration membranes and for novel silicon membranes having slit shaped nanopores of uniform size fabricated by photolithography using a sacrificial oxide technique. data are compared with theoretical calculations based on available hydrodynamic models for solute and solvent transport through membranes composed of a parallel array of either cylindrical or slit shaped pores. the results clearly demonstrate that membranes with slit shaped pores have higher performance, i.e., greater selectivity at a given value of the permeability, than membranes with cylindrical pores. theoretical calculations indicate that this improved performance becomes much less pronounced as the breadth of the pore size distribution increases. these results provide new insights into the effects of pore geometry on the performance of ultrafiltration membranes","Recent developments in materials science and nanotechnology have provided novel techniques for controlling not only the pore size and pore size distribution but also the pore geometry [, ]. Mehta and Zydney developed an appropriate framework for comparing the performance characteristics of different ultrafiltration membranes based on a plot of the membrane selectivity (or separation factor) as a function of the membrane hydraulic permeability (Lp). Chandler and Zydney showed that the initial rate of flux decline during yeast cell microfiltration was reduced for membranes with slit shaped pores compared to membranes with circular pores, with the difference in fouling behavior arising because the deposited cells are unable to fully block the slit shaped pores due to their high aspect ratio.This occurs when (11)=a23 which is 8/3 times the value for a membrane with cylindrical pores. Note that the data point plotted at = 9.8 1018 m2 actually had about twice this permeability; the results were plotted at the smaller value of so that the data point was visible on the plot in . This corresponds to a Reynolds number (based on the channel height) of around Re = 100 and a mass transfer coefficient of approximately km = 1.0 107 m/s as evaluated from the Leveque solution for fully developed channel flow .These parameters do not influence the results presented in because the data have been plotted as a function of the scaled permeability (as defined by ), which properly accounts for differences in the membrane porosity and thickness. This improved performance is a direct result of the reduced resistance to flow in a slit shaped pore compared to that in a cylindrical pore of the same critical dimension (rp = h). This effect was demonstrated experimentally using novel silicon membranes that have well defined arrays of uniform slit shaped pores, with the results in good agreement with theoretical predictions.","Recent developments in materials science and nanotechnology have provided novel techniques for controlling not only the pore size and pore size distribution but also the pore geometry [, ].

301,"random forests have emerged as one of the most commonly used nonparametric statistical methods in many scientific areas, particularly in analysis of high throughput genomic data. a general practice in using random forests is to generate a sufficiently large number of trees, although it is subjective as to how large is sufficient. furthermore, random forests are viewed as black box because of its sheer size. in this work, we address a fundamental issue in the use of random forests: how large does a random forest have to be? to this end, we propose a specific method to find a sub forest (e.g., in a single digit number of trees) that can achieve the prediction accuracy of a large random forest (in the order of thousands of trees). we tested it on extensive simulation studies and a real study on prognosis of breast cancer. the results show that such sub forests usually exist and most of them are very small, suggesting they are actually the representatives of the whole random forests. we conclude that the sub forests are indeed the core of a random forest. thus it is not necessary to use the whole forest for satisfying prediction performance. also, by reducing the size of a random forest to a manageable size, the random forest is no longer a black box.","This is what Breiman referred to as a black box in his 2002 Wald lectures presented at the annual meeting of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics.

304,"background across multiple mental health related measures, a polymorphism (5 httlpr) within the promoter of the serotonin transporter gene has been associated with differential psychological sensitivity to stressful experiences. yet, the specific mechanisms by which this polymorphism contributes to risk for psychological dysfunction is unclear. therefore, we investigated cortisol reactivity to psychosocial stress as a potential intermediate phenotype that may predispose to such risk. methods a psychologically healthy sample of young adults were genotyped for the 5 httlpr. each participant delivered a speech and performed mental arithmetic in one of three audience conditions: a critical evaluative audience, a supportive evaluative audience, or no audience. salivary cortisol was sampled at baseline and at 20, 40, and minutes after stressor onset. results the two evaluative audience conditions elicited similar, significant increases in cortisol that were significantly greater than in the no audience control. the evaluative audience conditions revealed a significant relationship between cortisol reactivity and the 5 httlpr, with the short/short genotype showing the greatest reactivity. internal analyses revealed that the 5 httlpr was significantly associated with cortisol reactivity in the negative audience condition only, suggesting that short/short individuals may be especially vulnerable to social threat. conclusions the short/short genotype of the 5 httlpr is associated with greater cortisol reactivity to social threat. when short/short individuals experience stressful life events, they may be at greater risk for the adverse psychological and physical health consequences associated with heightened cortisol exposure.","One marker of such variation is a polymorphism (5 HTTLPR) within the promoter of the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4).

305,"several methods have been proposed for motion correction of high angular resolution diffusion imaging (hardi) data. there have been few comparisons of these methods, partly due to a lack of quantitative metrics of performance. we compare two motion correction strategies using two figures of merit: displacement introduced by the motion correction and the 95% confidence interval of the cone of uncertainty of voxels with prolate tensors. what follows is a general approach for assessing motion correction of hardi data that may have broad application for quality assurance and optimization of postprocessing protocols. our analysis demonstrates two important issues related to motion correction of hardi data: 1) although neither method we tested was dramatically superior in performance, both were dramatically better than performing no motion correction, and 2) iteration of motion correction can improve the final results. based on the results demonstrated here, iterative motion correction is strongly recommended for hardi acquisitions.","Rohde et al. use a normalized mutual information cost function to optimize overlap between T2 weighted and diffusion weighted images.

309,"summary triglyceride storage in adipose tissue comprises the principal energy reserve in mammals. additionally glucose can be stored as glycogen in the fed state, primarily in liver and skeletal muscle, for mobilization during times of energy deficit. adipose tissue also contains glycogen stores albeit at very low levels. the physiological role of glycogen metabolism in adipocytes remains unclear. however, both classical literature and more recent work demonstrate that the dynamic regulation of adipose glycogen may serve as an energy sensing modality in the coordination of glucose and lipid metabolism in adipose tissue, especially during the fasted to fed transition.","Investigations spanning over a century have addressed the dynamics of adipocyte energy flux and the role of glycogen metabolism in these processes. These two publications separated by 66 years underscore the need for a fuller understanding of the role of glycogen turnover in the regulation of adipocyte energy metabolism. A recent publication highlighted the important yet undefined role of glycogen turnover during lipid synthesis in adipose tissue.Glycogen is also present in adipocytes albeit at much lower levels and the study of adipose glycogen metabolism has a long yet underappreciated history. First, because glycogen can not be transported across the cell membrane, this result demonstrated that the adipocyte was metabolically active, synthesizing glycogen de novo from glucose.

313,"nanomaterials hold much promise for biological applications, but they require appropriate functionalization to provide biocompatibility in biological environments. for non covalent functionalization with biocompatible polymers, the polymer must also remain attached to the nanomaterial after removal of its excess to mimic the high dilution conditions of administration in vivo. reported here are the synthesis and utilization singly substituted conjugates of dextran and a phospholipid (dextran dspe) as stable coatings for nanomaterials. suspensions of single walled carbon nanotubes were found not only to be stable to phosphate buffered saline (pbs), serum, and a variety of phs after excess polymer removal, but also provide brighter photoluminescence than carbon nanotubes suspended by poly(ethylene glycol) dspe. in addition, both gold nanoparticles (aunps) and gold nanorods (aunrs) were found to maintain their dispersion and characteristic optical absorbance after transfer into dextran dspe, and were obtained in much better yield than similar suspensions with peg phospholipid and commonly used thiol peg. these suspensions were also stable to pbs, serum, and a variety of phs after removal of excess polymer. dextran dspe thus shows great promise as a general surfactant material for the functionalization of a variety of nanomaterials, which could facilitate future biological applications.","In this paper, we report the synthesis of a phospholipid dextran conjugate, in which the phospholipid, 1,2 distearoyl sn glycero 3 phosphoethanolamine (DSPE), is bound at a single point to the reducing end of the dextran.

314,"background and objective a robust release of endothelin 1 1 (et) with subsequent eta subtype receptor (et ar) activation occurs in patients following cardiac surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass (cpb). increased et ar activation has been identified in patients with poor lv function (reduced ejection fraction; ef). accordingly, this study tested the hypothesis that a selective et ar antagonist (et ara) administered peri operatively would favorably affect post cpb hemodynamic profiles in patients with a pre existing poor lvef. methods and results patients (n=29; yrs) with a reduced lvef (372%) were prospectively randomized, in a blinded fashion, at the time of elective coronary revascularization and/or valve replacement requiring cpb, to infusion of the highly selective and potent et ara, sitaxsentan at or mg/kg (iv bolus; n=9, respectively) or vehicle (saline; n=10). infusion of the et ara/vehicle was performed immediately prior to separation from cpb and again at hrs post cpb. et and hemodynamic measurements were performed at baseline, at separation from cpb (time 0) and at 0.5, 6, 12, hrs post cpb. baseline plasma et (4.00.3 fmol/ml) was identical across all groups, but when compared to pre operative, baseline values obtained from age matched subjects with a normal lvef (n=37;lvef>50%), were significantly increased (2.90.2 fmol/ml, p<0.05) baseline systemic (svr; dscm 5) and pulmonary (pvr; dscm 5) vascular resistance were equivalent in all groups. as a function of time 0, svr changed in an equivalent fashion in the post cpb period, but a significant et ara effect was observed for pvr (anova; p<0.05). for example at hrs post cpb, pvr increased by d.scm 5 in the vehicle group, but directionally decreased by over dscm 5 in the mg/kg etara group (p<0.05). total adverse events were equivalently distributed across the et ara/placebo groups. conclusions these unique findings demonstrated that infusion of an et ara in high risk cardiac surgery patients was not associated with significant hemodynamic compromise. moreover, et ara favorably affected pvr in the early post operative period. thus, the et ar serves as a potential pharmacological target for improving outcomes following cardiac surgery in patients with compromised lv function.","Cardiopulmonary bypass (CBP) remains a mainstay for the performance of cardiac surgical procedures, including that of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and valve replacement.

317,"v(d)j recombination, the process that rearranges gene segments to assemble mature antigen receptor genes, relies on a recombinase comprising the rag1 and rag2 proteins. rag1 is a multi functional enzyme including dna binding and cleavage as well as ubiquitin ligase activities, all of which appear to contribute to its role in recombination. here we demonstrate that components of the ubiquitin conjugation machinery and the 26s proteasome are required for an early step in v(d)j recombination. inhibitors of the 26s proteasome and ubiquitin activating enzyme (e1) blocked both chromosomal and extra chromosomal recombination when added one hour following transfection/induction, but they had no effect when added hours later. there was no effect on expression of rag1, and recombination did not require transit through the cell cycle, confirming that inhibition was not due to an indirect effect on cell cycle arrest or protein expression. experiments in which rag1 translation was blocked with cyclohexamide after hours of expression indicated that many active recombination complexes were formed within this window, although recombination products continued to accumulate for hours. these data suggest that ubiquitin dependent degradation is an early step in complex assembly or activation, and are consistent with our previous hypothesis that degradation of a negative regulator is required to trigger recombination.","Ubiquitin conjugation is involved in regulation of nearly every biochemical system in eukaryotic cells .

319,"background recent work has demonstrated a link between retinopathy, a marker of microvascular disease, and the development of heart failure, a finding particularly relevant in individuals with diabetes. our objective was to assess the relationship between retinopathy and cardiac structure and function in a cohort of individuals with type diabetes. methods stereoscopic fundus photography of seven standard fields was obtained in mexican american adults with type diabetes recruited as sibships from starr county, texas. retinopathy was centrally scored and classified as no retinopathy, early nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy, moderate to severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy, or proliferative diabetic retinopathy. echocardiography was used to assess cardiac structure and function. multilevel mixed models were used to assess associations of clinical and echocardiographic variables with retinopathy while accounting for correlations among siblings. results more severe diabetic retinopathy was associated with the presence of hypertension, previous cardiovascular disease, longer duration of diabetes, elevated glycosylated hemoglobin, and greater albuminuria. with worsening severity of diabetic retinopathy, left ventricular (lv) mass and left atrial dimension increased, and lv ejection fraction and lv fractional shortening decreased, independent of potential confounding variables. conclusions more severe diabetic retinopathy was associated with worse cardiac structure and function by echocardiography independent of potential confounding variables. these data suggest a possible microvascular contribution to the development of diabetes associated cardiac enlargement and dysfunction. alternatively, common pathways may be leading to both disorders.","Once overt heart failure signs and/or symptoms develop in diabetic patients, the prognosis is poor. Recent data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study demonstrated a link between retinopathy, a marker of systemic microvascular disease, and the development of heart failure, a finding particularly relevant in individuals with diabetes. The mechanisms leading to the increased risk of heart failure in individuals with diabetes remain uncertain and are likely multifactorial.Nonetheless, the echocardiographic abnormalities identified in this study have been shown to be associated with subsequent adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Similarly, studies will need to be performed to confirm these findings in individuals with type 2 diabetes who are not ascertained through family membership.

Recent data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study demonstrated a link between retinopathy, a marker of systemic microvascular disease, and the development of heart failure, a finding particularly relevant in individuals with diabetes. The mechanisms leading to the increased risk of heart failure in individuals with diabetes remain uncertain and are likely multifactorial.Nonetheless, the echocardiographic abnormalities identified in this study have been shown to be associated with subsequent adverse cardiovascular outcomes.

330,"in common with other mendelian diseases, the presentation and progression of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (adpkd) varies widely in the population. the typical course is of adult onset disease with esrd in the 6th decade. however, a small proportion has adequate renal function into the 9th decade, whereas others present with enlarged kidneys as neonates. adpkd is genetically heterogeneous and the disease gene is a major determinant of severity; pkd1 on average is associated with esrd years earlier than pkd2. the majority of pkd1 and pkd2 mutations are likely fully inactivating, although recent studies indicate that some alleles retain partial activity, hypomorphic alleles. homozygotes for such alleles are viable and in combination with an inactivating allele can result in early onset disease. hypomorphic alleles and mosaicism may also account for some cases with unusually mild disease. the degree of phenotypic variation detected in families indicates that genetic background influences disease severity. genome wide association studies are planned to map common variants associated with severity. although adpkd is a simple genetic disease, fully understanding the phenotypic variability requires consideration of influences at the genic, allelic and genetic background level, and so ultimately is complex.","In contrast to complex genetic diseases (such as diabetes) the single gene in a Mendelian disorder, such as autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), determines if the individual develops the disease.

332,"oligosaccharyl transferase (ot) is a multi subunit enzyme that catalyzes n linked glycosylation of nascent polypeptides in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. in the case of saccharomyces cerevisiae, ot is composed of nine integral membrane protein subunits. defects in n linked glycosylation cause a series of disorders known as congenital disorders of glycosylation (cdg). the c terminal domain of stt3p subunit has been reported to contain the acceptor protein recognition site and/or catalytic site. we report here the subcloning, overexpression, a robust but novel method of production of pure c terminal domain of stt3p at mg/l in e. coli. cd spectra indicate that the c terminal stt3p is highly helical and has a stable tertiary structure in sds micelles. the well dispersed 2d {1h 15n} hsqc spectrum in sds micelles indicates that it is feasible to determine the atomic structure by nmr. the effect of the conserved d518e mutation on the conformation of the c terminal stt3p is particularly interesting. the comparative analysis of the fluorescence and nmr data of the mutant and the wild type c terminal domain of stt3p revealed that the replacement of the key residue asp518, which is located within the wwdyg signature motif (residues 516 520), led to a distinct tertiary structure, even though both proteins have similar overall secondary structures. this observation strongly suggests that asp518, which was previously proposed to primarily function as a catalytic residue, also plays a critical structural role. moreover, the activity of the protein was confirmed by saturation transfer difference (std) and nmr titration studies.","These observations unequivocally prove that the D518E mutation does result in a dramatic conformational change in the protein, thus interfering with its function . Results of circular dichroism (CD), fluorescence and NMR indicate that although the D518E mutant has an overall similar secondary structure to that of the wild type protein, its tertiary structure is remarkably different.

333,"increasing evidence indicates that early life glucocorticoid exposure, either involving stress or the therapy of preterm labor, contributes to metabolic and cardiovascular disorders in adulthood. we investigated cellular mechanisms underlying these effects by administering dexamethasone (dex) to neonatal rats on postnatal (pn) days or 79, using doses spanning the threshold for somatic growth impairment: 0.05, 0.2 and 0.8 mg/kg. in adulthood, we assessed the effects on hepatic and cardiac cell function mediated through the adenylyl cyclase (ac) signaling cascade, which controls neuronal and hormonal inputs that regulate hepatic glucose metabolism and cardiac contractility. treatment on pn1 3 produced heterologous sensitization of hepatic signaling, with upregulation of ac itself leading to parallel increases in the responses to adrenergic or glucagon receptor stimulation, or to activation of g proteins by fluoride. the effects were seen at the lowest dose but increasing dex past the point of somatic growth impairment led to loss of the effect in females. nonmonotonic effects were also present in the heart, where males showed ac sensitization at the lowest dose, with decreasing effects as the dose was raised; females showed progressive deficits of cardiac ac activity. shifting the exposure to pn7 9 still elicited ac sensitization but with a greater offsetting contribution at the higher doses. our findings show that, in contrast to growth restriction, the glucocorticoids associated with stress or the therapy of preterm labor are more sensitive and more important contributors to the cellular abnormalities underlying subsequent metabolic and cardiovascular dysfunction.","The three day regimens were chosen to correspond to multiple glucocorticoid courses, as used in approximately 85% of all cases of preterm delivery . This still leaves major uncertainties as to glucocorticoid effects relevant to stress, or at or below the threshold for typical therapeutic use in preterm infants.

338,"we have examined the association of tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (tagsnps) in peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma transcripts and (pparg1&2) and tagsnps in adiponectin (adipoq) genes for their effect on type diabetes (t2d) risk in asian indian sikhs. a total of t2d cases and normoglycemic (ng) controls were examined for association with t2d and other sub phenotypes of t2d. with the exception of a strong association of pparg2/pro12ala with t2d [or 0.13, 95%ci (0.030.56), p=0.0007], no other tagsnp in the pparg locus revealed any significant association with t2d in this population. similarly, none of the tagsnps in the adipoq gene was associated with t2d susceptibility in single site analysis. however, haplotype analysis provided strong evidence of association of these loci with t2d. three site haplotype analysis in the pparg locus using the two marginally associated snps (p/rs11715073 and p/rs3892175) in combination with pro12 ala (p/rs1801282) revealed a strong association of one risk (cgc) (p=0.003; permutation p=0.015) and one protective (cac) (p =0.001; permutation p=0.005) haplotype associated with t2d. however, the major effect still appears to be driven by pro12ala as the association of these haplotypes did not remain significant when analyzed conditional upon pro12ala (p = 0.262). additionally, two site haplotype analysis in the adipoq locus using only two marginally associated snps (ad/rs182052 and ad/rs7649121) revealed a significant protective association of the ga haplotype with t2d (p=0.009; permutation p=0.026). multiple linear regression analysis also revealed significant association of an adipoq variant (ad/rs12495941) with total body weight (p= 0.010), waist (p=0.024) and hip (p=0.021), although these associations were not significant after adjusting for multiple testing. our new findings strongly suggest that the genetic variation in pparg and adipoq loci could contribute to risk for the development of t2d in indian sikhs. identification of causal snps in these important biological and positional candidate genes would help determine true physiological significance of these loci in t2d and obesity.","Asian Indians, 25% of the global population, make up the greatest proportion of diabetics in the world .

339,"three dimensional microwave tomography represents a potentially very important advance over 2d techniques because it eliminates associated approximations which may lead to more accurate images. however, with the significant increase in problem size, computational efficiency is critical to making 3d microwave imaging viable in practice. in this paper, we present two 3d image reconstruction methods utilizing 3d scalar and vector field modeling strategies, respectively. finite element (fe) and finite difference time domain (fdtd) algorithms are used to model the electromagnetic field interactions in human tissue in 3d. image reconstruction techniques previously developed for the 2d problem, such as the dual mesh scheme, iterative block solver, and adjoint jacobian method are extended directly to 3d reconstructions. speed improvements achieved by setting an initial field distribution and utilizing an alternating direction implicit (adi) fdtd are explored for 3d vector field modeling. the proposed algorithms are tested with simulated data and correctly recovered the position, size and electrical properties of the target. the adjoint formulation and the fdtd method utilizing initial field estimates are found to be significantly more effective in reducing the computation time. finally, these results also demonstrate that cross plane measurements are critical for reconstructing 3d profiles of the target.","Approximations are necessary in order to utilize 2D methods, such as the tissues of interest being cylindrical in structure, and in most instances, the fields being confined to the transverse magnetic (TM) mode.

344,"a current challenge in interpretation of genome wide association studies (gwas) is to establish the mechanistic links between the measured genotype and observed phenotype. the integration of gene expression with disease gwas is emerging as an important strategy for deciphering these regulatory mechanisms. for renal disease, the availability of both tissue and disease specific expression data makes the strategy a compelling option. in this review, three approaches of integrating single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) genotypes with transcriptional regulation are discussed: (1) interpreting the functional role of transcripts affected by a snp, (2) identifying the mechanistic role of non coding snps in regulation, and (3) identifying regulatory candidate snps with expression associations. combining these strategies in an integrative manner should allow the discovery of more extensive regulatory information. linking genetics to systems biology more directly promises the opportunity to explain how genetic variants contribute to disease in a truly holistic manner.","Finally, we discuss how these strategies can be used in an integrative manner to generate more extensive and definitive mechanistic information . Also, our focus is on non coding SNPs because, first, these variants have been the most common output from GWAS analysis, and, second, because their mechanism and function are less well defined than alterations in protein coding regions . Measuring changes in genome wide transcript abundance in glomeruli and tubulointerstitial compartments of kidney biopsies can define the effect(s) of CKD associated SNPs on transcriptional regulatory mechanisms.An advantage to this approach is that it does not require a priori functional characterization of the candidate transcript, and has the potential to provide initial clues on the regulatory pathways associated with a novel gene. However, the functional mechanism responsible for co regulation may range from a direct interaction at the molecular level to alteration in the cellular fabric of the tissues studied. Next, differential regulation of transcripts in tissue compartments involved in disease manifestation could be assessed.For renal disease, the availability of both tissue and disease specific expression makes the strategy even stronger . Co regulation and transcriptional network modeling approaches can be used to established de novo disease specific networks potentially impacted by the candidate gene .

345,"spectral cytopathology, scp, is a novel approach for diagnostic differentiation of disease in individual exfoliated cells. scp is carried out by collecting information on each cells biochemical composition via an infrared micro spectral measurement, followed by multivariate data analysis. deviations from a cells natural composition produce specific spectral patterns that are exclusive to the cause of the deviation or disease. these unique spectral patterns are reproducible and can be identified and employed via multivariate statistical methods to detect cells compromised at the molecular level by dysplasia, neoplasia, or viral infection. in this proof of concept study, a benchmark for the sensitivity of scp is established by classifying healthy oral squamous cells according to their anatomical origin in the oral cavity. classification is achieved by spectrally detecting cells with unique protein expressions: for example, the squamous cells of the tongue are the only cell type in the oral cavity that have intracytoplasmic significant amounts of keratin, which allows them to be spectrally differentiated from other oral mucosa cells. furthermore, thousands of cells from a number of clinical specimens were examined, among them squamous cell carcinoma, malignancy associate changes including reactive atypia, and infection by the herpes simplex virus. due to its sensitivity to molecular changes, scp often can detect the onset of disease earlier than is currently possible by cytopathology visualization. since scp is based on automated instrumentation and unsupervised software, it constitutes a diagnostic workup of medical samples devoid of bias and inconsistency. therefore, scp shows potential as complementary tool in medical cytopathology.","Tens of thousands of oral cells were interrogated and spectrally classified by anatomical position, drug metabolism, malignancy associated changes including reactive atypia, dysplasia, squamous cell carcinoma, and viral infection. The lack of reproducibility of pathology was most evident, again, for less severe cases.

This was accomplished by raster scanning the substrate through the focus (6.25 m 6.25 m in size) of a beam of IR light using one of two PerkinElmer Spotlight 400 FTIR Imaging Systems (Perkin Elmer, Shelton, CT USA) in the Laboratory for Spectral Diagnosis at Northeastern University. The instrument optical bench, the infrared microscope and an external microscope enclosure box were purged with a continuous stream of dry air (40 C dew point) to reduce atmospheric water vapor spectral contributions.Phosphate band intensities may increase as cancerous cells have increased rates of replication. This is the main advantage of SCP over conventional methodology: providing a diagnostic workup which tracks biomolecular changes and trends preserved throughout dysplasia and into neoplasia, evident well before morphological compromise . We postulate the variations observed in the frequency range of 1465 to 1360 cm1 are contributed by the carboxylic acid functional group of isobutyl propanoic phenolic acid.","Tens of thousands of oral cells were interrogated and spectrally classified by anatomical position, drug metabolism, malignancy associated changes including reactive atypia, dysplasia, squamous cell carcinoma, and viral infection.

This was accomplished by raster scanning the substrate through the focus (6.25 m 6.25 m in size) of a beam of IR light using one of two PerkinElmer Spotlight 400 FTIR Imaging Systems (Perkin Elmer, Shelton, CT USA) in the Laboratory for Spectral Diagnosis at Northeastern University. The instrument optical bench, the infrared microscope and an external microscope enclosure box were purged with a continuous stream of dry air (40 C dew point) to reduce atmospheric water vapor spectral contributions.Phosphate band intensities may increase as cancerous cells have increased rates of replication. This is the main advantage of SCP over conventional methodology: providing a diagnostic workup which tracks biomolecular changes and trends preserved throughout dysplasia and into neoplasia, evident well before morphological compromise . We postulate the variations observed in the frequency range of 1465 to 1360 cm1 are contributed by the carboxylic acid functional group of isobutyl propanoic phenolic acid.",0.41516966067864275,0.08817635270541083,0.1985707667553125,0.41516966067864275,0.08817635270541083,0.1985707667553125
346,"the standard, well established sample preparation protocol to release n linked glycans from glycoproteins for downstream analysis requires relatively long deglycosylation times (from several hours to overnight) and relatively high endoglycosidase concentration (1:250 1:500 enzyme:substrate molar ratio). in this paper, we significantly improve this standard protocol by the use of pressure cycling technology (pct) to increase the speed and decrease the relative amount of pngase f during the release of n linked glycans from denatured glycoproteins. with the application of pressure cycling from atmospheric to as high as kpsi, >95% release of the asparagine linked glycans from bovine ribonuclease b, human transferrin and polyclonal human immunoglobulin was rapidly achieved in a few minutes using as low as 1:2500 enzyme:substrate molar ratio. the deglycosylation rate was first examined by sds page at the protein level. the released glycans were then quantitated by capillary electrophoresis with laser induced fluorescence detection (ce lif). this new sample preparation protocol readily supports large scale glycan analysis of biopharmaceuticals with rapid deglycosylation times.","It is believed that the high pressure changes protein conformation and forces the penetration of water molecules into the protein interior (especially into cavities); thereby, leading to unfolding. In addition to the advantages of speed, PCT did not cause decomposition (e.g., desialylation) of the glycan structures under investigation. The basis of this method is the application of alternating cycles of atmospheric and high pressure of up to tens of kpsi (1 kpsi = 6.895 MPa).IgGs are large glycoproteins with a single conserved N glycosylation site at Asn297 on both heavy chains in the CH2 domain of the Fc region. Trace D in depicts the control deglycosylation experiment at atmospheric pressure for 5 minutes showing essentially no glycan release. We speculate that, under high pressure conditions, the precipitated aggregate partially disintegrated, resulting in more exposure and consequently improved access of the enzyme to the glycosylation sites.The target glycoproteins required reduction of the disulfide bridges and heat denaturation prior to PCT treatment. Although, we have only demonstrated the utilization of PCT assisted glycan release with electrophoresis, this method could obviously be used in conjunction with other well established carbohydrate characterization techniques of LC, MS and NMR . We consider that the high pressure facilitated conformation changes of the target glycoprotein, which in conjunction with the alternation between high and atmospheric pressure probably resulted in rapid unfolding and folding, increasing the accessibility of the endoglycosidase to the cleavage sites.","It is believed that the high pressure changes protein conformation and forces the penetration of water molecules into the protein interior (especially into cavities); thereby, leading to unfolding.

348,"purpose to evaluate the impact of atypical retardation patterns (arp) on detection of progressive retinal nerve fiber layer (rnfl) loss using scanning laser polarimetry with variable corneal compensation (vcc). design observational cohort study. methods the study included eyes of patients with a median follow up of 4.0 years. images were obtained annually with the gdx vcc (carl zeiss meditec inc, dublin, california, usa), along with optic disc stereophotographs and standard automated perimetry (sap) visual fields. progression was determined by the guided progression analysis software for sap and by masked assessment of stereophotographs by expert graders. the typical scan score (tss) was used to quantify the presence of arps on gdx vcc images. random coefficients models were used to evaluate the relationship between arp and rnfl thickness measurements over time. results thirty eight eyes (10%) showed progression over time on visual fields, stereophotographs, or both. changes in tss scores from baseline were significantly associated with changes in rnfl thickness measurements in both progressing and nonprogressing eyes. each 1 unit increase in tss score was associated with a 0.19 m decrease in rnfl thickness measurement (p < .001) over time. conclusions arps had a significant effect on detection of progressive rnfl loss with the gdx vcc. eyes with large amounts of atypical patterns, great fluctuations on these patterns over time, or both may show changes in measurements that can appear falsely as glaucomatous progression or can mask true changes in the rnfl.","Soon after the introduction of the GDx VCC, however, scans showing atypical retardation patterns (ARP) were observed in some eyes imaged with this instrument. In the current study, we expanded our cohort to include eyes with a large range of ARP severities, and we investigated changes in ARPs over time and their influence on the detection of progressive RNFL loss with this instrument . SCANNING LASER POLARIMETRY IS DESIGNED TO PROvide real time objective measurements for assessing the thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL).Time (variable TIME) was included as a continuous predictor.

349,"estimating organ residence times is an essential part of patient specific dosimetry for radioimmunotherapy (rit). quantitative imaging methods for rit are often evaluated using a single physical or simulated phantom but are intended to be applied clinically where there is variability in patient anatomy, biodistribution, and biokinetics. to provide a more relevant evaluation, the authors have thus developed a population of phantoms with realistic variations in these factors and applied it to the evaluation of quantitative imaging methods both to find the best method and to demonstrate the effects of these variations. using whole body scans and spect/ct images, organ shapes and time activity curves of 111in ibritumomab tiuxetan were measured in dosimetrically important organs in seven patients undergoing a high dose therapy regimen. based on these measurements, we created a 3d nurbs based cardiac torso (ncat) based phantom population. spect and planar data at realistic count levels were then simulated using previously validated monte carlo simulation tools. the projections from the population were used to evaluate the accuracy and variation in accuracy of residence time estimation methods that used a time series of spect and planar scans. quantitative spect (qspect) reconstruction methods were used that compensated for attenuation, scatter, and the collimator detector response. planar images were processed with a conventional (cplanar) method that used geometric mean attenuation and triple energy window scatter compensation and a quantitative planar (qplanar) processing method that used model based compensation for image degrading effects. residence times were estimated from activity estimates made at each of five time points. the authors also evaluated hybrid methods that used cplanar or qplanar time activity curves rescaled to the activity estimated from a single qspect image. the methods were evaluated in terms of mean relative error and standard deviation of the relative error in the residence time estimates taken over the phantom population. the mean errors in the residence time estimates over all the organs were <9.9% (pure qspect), <13.2% (pure qplanar), <7.2% (hybrid qplanar/qspect), <19.2% (hybrid cplanar/qspect), and 7%159% (pure cplanar). the standard deviations of the errors for all the organs over all the phantoms were <9.9%, <11.9%, <10.8%, <22.0%, and <107.9% for the same methods, respectively. the processing methods differed both in terms of their average accuracy and the variation of the accuracy over the population of phantoms, thus demonstrating the importance of using a phantom population in evaluating quantitative imaging methods. hybrid cplanar/qspect provided improved accuracy compared to pure cplanar and required the addition of only a single spect acquisition. the qplanar or hybrid qplanar/qspect methods had mean errors and standard deviations of errors that approached those of pure qspect while providing simplified image acquisition protocols, and thus may be more clinically practical.","First, obtaining sufficient numbers of patients can be both expensive and time consuming. There are currently no direct measurement methods feasible for routine clinical use. Those parameters are usually estimated by integrating organ time activity curves (TACs) estimated from measurements of organ activity at multiple time points.Scatter was modeled using the effective source scatter estimation (ESSE) method. Organ activities were then estimated as the set of scale factors for each individual organ projection that gave the best match, in a maximum likelihood sense, between the measured projections and the sum of the scaled organ VOI projections. The average of the true attenuation maps for the 171 and 245 keV photons emitted by 111In was used for the attenuation modeling.These reflect the accuracy of the shape of the estimated TAC. Due to their simpler acquisition and processing protocols, the hybrid methods may be more clinically practical and thus the methods of choice for clinical practice . For a relatively isolated and large organ such as the liver, the CPlanar Realistic method worked relatively well, as might be expected.","First, obtaining sufficient numbers of patients can be both expensive and time consuming.

(2) is outer retina function following enucleation and reperfusion improved compared with enucleation alone? (3) following optic nerve transection, is there a correlation between retinal ganglion cell (rgc) survival and either time after transection or proximity of the transection to the globe? in a majority of the studies performed in the literature, recovery of visual function can occur after whole eye transplantation in cold blooded vertebrates. following enucleation (and reperfusion), outer retinal function is maintained from to h. rgc survival following optic nerve transection is inversely related to both the time since transection and the proximity of transection to the globe. lastly, neurotrophins can increase rgc survival following optic nerve transection. this review of the literature suggests that the use of a donor eye is feasible for whole eye transplantation.","Here we provide a comprehensive understanding of the current literature regarding ocular viability of the donor eye.

353,"accurate refractive index measurement in the deep ultraviolet (uv) range is important for the separate quantification of biomolecules such as proteins and dna in biology. this task is demanding and has not been fully exploited so far. here we report a new method of measuring refractive index using field based light scattering spectroscopy, which is applicable to any wavelength range and suitable for both solutions and homogenous objects with well defined shape such as microspheres. the angular scattering distribution of single microspheres immersed in homogeneous media is measured over the wavelength range to nm using quantitative phase microscopy. by least square fitting the observed scattering distribution with mie scattering theory, the refractive index of either the sphere or the immersion medium can be determined provided that one is known a priori. using this method, we have measured the refractive index dispersion of sio2 spheres and bovine serum albumin (bsa) solutions in the deep uv region. specific refractive index increments of bsa are also extracted. typical accuracy of the present refractive index technique is 0.003. the precision of refractive index measurements is 0.002 and that of specific refractive index increment determination is 0.01 ml/g.","This method has several advantages over the traditional reflectance or refraction based method.

360,"in the present study, we investigated if attention to faces results in sensory gain modulation. participants were cued to attend to faces or scenes in superimposed face scene images while face discriminability was parametrically manipulated across images. the face sensitive n170 event related potential component was used as a measure of early face processing. attention to faces modulated n170 amplitude, but only when faces were not highly discriminable. additionally, directing attention to faces modulated later processing (~230300 msec) for all discriminability levels. these results demonstrate that attention to faces can modulate perceptual processing of faces at multiple stages of processing, including early sensory levels. critically, the early attentional benefit is present only when the face signal (i.e., the perceptual quality of the face) in the environment is suboptimal.","The superimposed images occupied the same spatial extent, minimizing confounds due to spatially directed attention. Neither an automatic face processing view nor a late face selection view offers a sufficient explanation for empirical demonstrations of M170/N170 modulations .

Importantly, behavioral measures indexed participants response to the attended item in the overlay stimulus, while the N170 indexed participants response to the face in the overlay stimulus, whether it was attended or unattended.That is, categories of stimuli other than faces evoke an N170, albeit to a lesser degree than faces .

361,"prevalence and validation studies rely on imperfect reference standard (rs) diagnostic instruments which can bias prevalence and test characteristic estimates. we illustrate two methods to account for rs misclassification. latent class analysis (lca) combines information from multiple imperfect measures of an unmeasurable latent condition to estimate sensitivity (se) and specificity (sp) of each measure. simple algebraic sensitivity analysis (sa) uses researcher specified rs misclassification rates to correct prevalence and test characteristic estimates, and can succinctly summarize a range of scenarios with monte carlo simulation. we applied lca to a validation study of a new substance use disorder (sud) screener and a larger prevalence study. a traditional validation study analysis that assumed an error free rs (scid) estimated the screener had 86% se/75% sp. validation study estimates from lca were 91% se/81% sp (screener) and 73% se/98% sp (scid). sa in the prevalence study suggested the prevalence of sud was underestimated by 22% by assuming the scid to be error free. lca and sa can assist investigators in relaxing the unrealistic assumption of perfect rss in reporting prevalence and validation study results.","Corrected test characteristics and prevalence can then be directly calculated from the true table.

366,"brain tissue segmentation of neonate mr images is a challenging task in study of early brain development, due to low signal contrast among brain tissues and high intensity variability especially in white matter. among various brain tissue segmentation algorithms, the atlas based segmentation techniques can potentially produce reasonable segmentation results on neonatal brain images. however, their performance on the population based atlas is still limited due to the high variability of brain structures across different individuals. moreover, it may be impossible to generate a reasonable probabilistic atlas for neonates without tissue segmentation samples. to overcome these limitations, we present a neonatal brain tissue segmentation method by taking advantage of the longitudinal data available in our study to establish a subject specific probabilistic atlas. in particular, tissue segmentation of the neonatal brain is formulated as two iterative steps of bias correction and probabilistic atlas based tissue segmentation, along with the guidance of brain tissue segmentation resulted from the later time images of the same subject which serve as a subject specific probabilistic atlas. the proposed method has been evaluated qualitatively through visual inspection and quantitatively by comparing with manual delineation results. experimental results show that the utilization of a subject specific probabilistic atlas can substantially improve tissue segmentation of neonatal brain images.","MRI studies in neonates have attracted a lot of research interests in brain development due to its potential to reveal the early brain developing pattern .

367,"high altitude environments (>2,500 m) provide scientists with a natural laboratory to study the physiological and genetic effects of low ambient oxygen tension on human populations. one approach to understanding how life at high altitude has affected human metabolism is to survey genome wide datasets for signatures of natural selection. in this work, we report on a study to identify selection nominated candidate genes involved in adaptation to hypoxia in one highland group, andeans from the south american altiplano. we analysed dense microarray genotype data using four test statistics that detect departures from neutrality. using a candidate gene, single nucleotide polymorphism based approach, we identified genes exhibiting preliminary evidence of recent genetic adaptation in this population. these included genes that are part of the hypoxia inducible transcription factor (hif) pathway, a biochemical pathway involved in oxygen homeostasis, as well as three other genomic regions previously not known to be associated with high altitude phenotypes. in addition to identifying selection nominated candidate genes, we also tested whether the hif pathway shows evidence of natural selection. our results indicate that the genes of this biochemical pathway as a group show no evidence of having evolved in response to hypoxia in andeans. results from particular hif targeted genes, however, suggest that genes in this pathway could play a role in andean adaptation to high altitude, even if the pathway as a whole does not show higher relative rates of evolution. these data suggest a genetic role in high altitude adaptation and provide a basis for genotype/phenotype association studies that are necessary to confirm the role of putative natural selection candidate genes and gene regions in adaptation to altitude.","Overall, this research has led to a substantial body of literature documenting the suite of human physiological responses to high altitude habitation (for a review, see Hornbein and Schoene) . Each of these populations exhibits unique circulatory, respiratory and haematological adaptations to life at high altitude. Several recent studies have analysed dense single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotype data to detect signatures of selection in three major continental groups: West Africans, East Asians and Northern Europeans.Missing genotypes were inferred for all populations. For the WGLRH test, significance was assessed by comparing the relative extended haplotype homozygosity (REHH) of a specific core haplotype with the gamma distribution and applying the false discovery rate (FDR) approach to correct for multiple tests.

370,"ptsd is also a complex disorder, and some studies have found that samples of individuals with ptsd contain subtypes that may relate to health outcomes. the goals were to replicate previously identified ptsd subtypes and examine how subtype membership relates to mortality. data from the vietnam experience study and a clinical sample of vietnam veterans were combined (n = 5248) to address these research questions. consistent with previous studies, three ptsd subtypes emerged: externalizers (n=317), internalizers (n=579), and low pathology (n=280). ptsd diagnosis was associated with increased risk of all cause and behavioral cause (e.g., homicide, suicide) mortality. both externalizing and internalizing subtypes had higher mortality and were more likely to die from cardiovascular causes than those without ptsd. externalizers were more likely to die from substance related causes than those without ptsd. the value of considering possible ptsd subtypes is significant in that it may contribute to identifying more specific targets for treatment and rehabilitation in veterans with ptsd.","Diagnoses of antisocial behavior, alcohol dependence, cannabis dependence, and drug dependence were more associated with externalizing problems, while major depressive disorder, panic disorder, simple phobia, and social phobia were more associated with internalizing problems .

371,"objective this study aimed to investigate empirically how and in what way individuals with symptoms of functional somatic syndromes should be classified. we also aimed to look into genetic and environmental influences on the classification. method a total of twins aged underwent screening interviews via a computer assisted data collection system from to 2002. nine functional somatic symptoms (abnormal tiredness, general muscular pain, recurrent abdominal discomfort, back pain, gastroesophageal reflux, recurrent headache, recurrent urinary problem, dizziness, breathlessness at rest) were assessed using structured questions in a blinded manner. latent class analysis was applied to the data. structural equation modeling was further performed in order to estimate the relative importance of genetic and environmental influences on class probability. results latent class analysis resulted in a 5 class solution. individuals in the first class did not show any health problems. those assigned to the second, third, and fourth classes tended to have abnormal tiredness, gastrointestinal problems, and pain related symptoms, respectively. individuals in the fifth class had multiple symptoms to a greater extent than the other classes. all the five classes showed modest genetic influences (7 29% of the total variation) with gender differences except class 3; however, the majority of influences on the class membership derived from unique environmental effects. conclusion the findings suggested the necessity of re defining the existing classification criteria for functional somatic syndromes in terms of single (uncomplicated) or multiple (complicated) syndromes. environmental influences are important for the aetiology of functional somatic syndromes.","In our previous study , we proposed a model that explains genetic and environmental structure of these syndromes and estimated the relative importance of factors in common to the syndromes. However, a limitation of the previous study was that the definitions of these syndromes were based on existing classification criteria (e.g. 1994 criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome ), which has not been empirically confirmed yet and are possibly inclined to identify individuals with multiple symptoms . Functional somatic syndromes are common not only in clinical settings but also in the general population, and are a major health issue in practically all areas of medicine [, ].Further understanding can be obtained by analysing additional data not entered into the model (e.g. age, gender, and the prevalence of relevant syndromes or illnesses) . To select the best fitting model, we compared the change in the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), which is a goodness of fit index that considers the rule of parsimony. We used the following nine somatic symptoms in this analysis: three cardinal symptoms of the three functional somatic syndromes, that is, abnormal tiredness lasting at least six months (without any exclusionary condition), widespread pain lasting at least three months, and abdominal discomfort lasting at least seven days per month in the past year; and six bodily symptoms as lifetime occurrence, that is, prolonged joint pain, back pain, gastroesophageal reflux, recurrent headache, recurrent urinary problem, and dizziness .Although Class 2 included 10.6% of individuals having idiopathic chronic fatigue (without regard to the ancillary symptoms), the prevalence of chronic fatigue syndrome (with four or more ancillary symptoms) was only 2.6%. Furthermore, the relative importance of nonshared environmental effects was pronounced in all the classes .

372,"cell laden hydrogels show great promise for creating engineered tissues. however, a major shortcoming with these systems has been the inability to fabricate structures with controlled microscale features on a biologically relevant length scale. here we demonstrate a rapid method for creating centimeter scale, cell laden hydrogels through the assembly of shape controlled microgels. this was achieved by using an approach that uses the liquid air interface of a hydrophobic solution to drive the assembly of microgels. cell laden microgels of specific shapes were randomly placed on the surface of a high density, hydrophobic solution and induced to aggregate and were subsequently crosslinked into macroscale tissue like structures. the resultant assemblies were cell laden hydrogel sheets consisting of tightly packed ordered microgel units. in addition, a hierarchical approach created complex multi gel building blocks which were then assembled into tissues with precise spatial control over the cell distribution. these data demonstrate that forces at an air liquid interface can be used to self assemble spatially controllable, co cultured tissue like structures.","As a result, fabrication of three dimensional (3D) organs is of great importance for regenerative medicine. The tissue microarchitecture in the human body is often made of repeating functional units, such as the repeating hexagonal lobules in the liver. The hight density solution forced the lower density hydrophilic hydrogels to remain on the surface similar to techniques previously reported for inorganic materials.No additional unreacted PEG is necessary to add to be able to achieve secondary and tertiary polymerizations, consistent with previous studies. Fabricating complex tissues requires the co culture of different cell types in physiologically relevant geometrical patterns. Improved control over the assembly process was implemented by rendering certain faces of the modules hydrophobic or hydrophilic.This work introduces a fabrication method for creating cell laden tissue like structures using a bottom up self assembly approach in a multi phase environment (liquid air system). Even greater control over this technique can be achieved by using specific structures, such as lock and key assemblies, to better direct the assembly of co cultured tissues. The ability to precisely control the cell distribution within self assembled tissue like constructs could greatly improve engineered tissue function and morphology.","As a result, fabrication of three dimensional (3D) organs is of great importance for regenerative medicine.

373,"we describe a neuro imaging protocol that utilizes an anatomical atlas of the human head to guide diffuse optical tomography of human brain activation. the protocol is demonstrated by imaging the hemodynamic response to median nerve stimulation in three healthy subjects, and comparing the images obtained using a head atlas with the images obtained using the subject specific head anatomy. the results indicate that using the head atlas anatomy it is possible to reconstruct the location of the brain activation to the expected gyrus of the brain, in agreement with the results obtained with the subject specific head anatomy. the benefits of this novel method derive from eliminating the need for subject specific head anatomy and thus obviating the need for a subject specific mri to improve the anatomical interpretation of diffuse optical tomography images of brain activation.","Diffuse Optical Tomography (DOT) is the tomographic variant of Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS).

374,"mutations in valosin containing protein (vcp) cause inclusion body myopathy (ibm) associated with paget's disease of the bone (pdb) and fronto temporal dementia (ftd) or ibmpfd. although ibmpfd is a multisystem disorder, muscle weakness is the presenting symptom in greater than half of patients and an isolated symptom in 30%. patients with the full spectrum of the disease make up only 12% of those affected; therefore it is important to consider and recognize ibmpfd in a neuromuscular clinic. the current review describes the skeletal muscle phenotype and common muscle histochemical features in ibmpfd. in addition to myopathic features; vacuolar changes and tubulofilamentous inclusions are found in a subset of patients. the most consistent findings are vcp, ubiquitin and tar dna binding protein (tdp 43) positive inclusions. vcp is a ubiquitously expressed multifunctional protein that is a member of the aaa+ (atpase associated with various activities) protein family. it has been implicated in multiple cellular functions ranging from organelle biogenesis to protein degradation. although the role of vcp in skeletal muscle is currently unknown, it is clear that vcp mutations lead to the accumulation of ubiquitinated inclusions and protein aggregates in patient tissue, transgenic animals and in vitro systems. we suggest that ibmpfd is novel type of protein surplus myopathy. instead of accumulating a poorly degraded and aggregated mutant protein as seen in some myofibrillar and nemaline myopathies, vcp mutations disrupt its normal role in protein homeostasis resulting in the accumulation of ubiquitinated and aggregated proteins that are deleterious to skeletal muscle.","Most notably, a multisystem myotonic disorder with frontotemporal dementia was described that subsequently was recharacterized as IBMPFD once VCP gene testing was performed .

378,"the clinical application of the concept of patient autonomy has centered on the ability to deliberate and make treatment decisions (decisional autonomy) to the virtual exclusion of the capacity to execute the treatment plan (executive autonomy). however, the one component concept of autonomy is problematic in the context of multiple chronic conditions. adherence to complex treatments commonly breaks down when patients have functional, educational, and cognitive barriers that impair their capacity to plan, sequence, and carry out tasks associated with chronic care. the purpose of this article is to call for a two component re conceptualization of autonomy and to argue that the clinical assessment of capacity for patients with chronic conditions should be expanded to include both autonomous decision making and autonomous execution of the agreed upon treatment plan. we explain how the concept of autonomy should be expanded to include both decisional and executive autonomy, describe the biopsychosocial correlates of the two component concept of autonomy, and recommend diagnostic and treatment strategies to support patients with deficits in executive autonomy.","The ethical principle of respect for autonomy requires that the patient with decisional autonomy be accorded authority over what will or will not be done regarding his or her medical care .

381,"renin is the key regulated step in the enzymatic cascade that leads to angiotensin generation and the control of blood pressure and fluid/electrolyte homeostasis. in the adult unstressed animal, renin is synthesized and released by renal juxtaglomerular cells. however, when homeostasis is threatened, the number of cells that express and release renin increases and extends beyond the juxtaglomerular area; the result is an increase in circulating renin and the reestablishment of homeostasis. the increase in the number of renin cells, a process termed recruitment, is achieved by dedifferentiation and re expression of renin in cells derived from the renin lineage. the mechanisms that regulate the related processes of reacquisition of the renin phenotype, renin synthesis, and renin release are beginning to be understood. numerous studies point to camp as a central common factor for the regulation of renin phenotype. in addition, we are seeing the emergence of gap junctions and micrornas as new and promising avenues for a more complete understanding of the complex regulation of the renin cell.","Renin also plays a fundamental role in kidney development. cAMP is critically involved in all three major mechanisms controlling renin synthesis and release: In addition, recent information on gap junctions and the role of microRNAs (miRNAs)small, noncoding RNAsis discussed .The enhancer sequence is highly homologous in the renin gene of mouse, rat, and human.

382,"parkinson's disease (pd) is a common neurodegenerative movement disorder afflicting millions of people in the united states. the advent of transgenic technologies has contributed to the development of several new mouse models, many of which recapitulate some aspects of the disease; however, no model has been demonstrated to faithfully reproduce the full constellation of symptoms seen in human pd. this may be due in part to the narrow focus on the dopamine mediated motor deficits. as current research continues to unmask pd as a multi system disorder, animal models should similarly evolve to include the non motor features of the disease. this requires that typically cited behavioral test batteries be expanded. the major non motor symptoms observed in pd patients include hyposmia, sleep disturbances, gastrointestinal dysfunction, autonomic dysfunction, anxiety, depression, and cognitive decline. mouse behavioral tests exist for all of these symptoms and while some models have begun to be reassessed for the prevalence of this broader behavioral phenotype, the majority has not. moreover, all behavioral paradigms should be tested for their responsiveness to l dopa so these data can be compared to patient response and help elucidate which symptoms are likely not dopamine mediated. here, we suggest an extensive, yet feasible, battery of behavioral tests for mouse models of pd aimed to better assess both non motor and motor deficits associated with the disease.","However, there are many non motor symptoms associated with PD that can appear years, sometimes decades, before the onset of the motor phenotype [ ].

384,"this paper reports a new strategy, recursive directional ligation by plasmid reconstruction (pre rdl), to rapidly clone highly repetitive polypeptides of any sequence and specified length over a large range of molecular weights. in a single cycle of pre rdl, two halves of a parent plasmid, each containing a copy of an oligomer, are ligated together, thereby dimerizing the oligomer and reconstituting a functional plasmid. this process is carried out recursively to assemble an oligomeric gene with the desired number of repeats. pre rdl has several unique features that stem from the use of type iis restriction endonucleases: first, pre rdl is a seamless cloning method that leaves no extraneous nucleotides at the ligation junction. because it uses type iis endonucleases to ligate the two halves of the plasmid, pre rdl also addresses the major limitation of rdl in that it abolishes any restriction on the gene sequence that can be oligomerized. the reconstitution of a functional plasmid only upon successful ligation in pre rdl also addresses two other limitations of rdl: the significant background from self ligation of the vector observed in rdl, and the decreased efficiency of ligation due to nonproductive circularization of the insert. pre rdl can also be used to assemble genes that encode different sequences in a predetermined order to encode block copolymers or append leader and trailer peptide sequences to the oligomerized gene.","Furthermore, we illustrate the versatility of the system by incorporating additional non ELP peptide sequences at the N and C terminus of the polypeptides.

Rather than inserting a DNA gene sequence to be inserted in a target organism, one can temporarily store a random number by inserting its corresponding DNA sequence into the plasmid . In order to retrieve the random sequence from the vector, the process of insertion is reversed .Long term storage is achieved through spotted microarray fabrication, which enables each sequences expression levels to be permanently stored . The sequences can then be evaluated to confirm randomness . This work was done in conjunction with a vision that DNA based circuitry, when the technology matures, will form the basis for a tamper proof security module, revolutionizing the meaning and concept of tamper proofing and possibly preventing it altogether based on accurate scientific observations.",0.5154061624649859,0.2985915492957747,0.363538612222628,0.5154061624649859,0.2985915492957747,0.363538612222628

396,"contemporary genomic tools now allow the fast and reliable genotyping of hundreds of thousands of variants and permit an unbiased interrogation of the common variability across the human genome. these technical advances have been the basis of numerous recent investigations of genes underlying complex genetic traits, and the results for blood pressure and hypertension have been of particular interest. the pathophysiology of the complex genetic trait blood pressure and hypertension is unclear. the heritability of essential hypertension is high and insights can be gained by finding associated genes. current genome wide association studies (gwas) have identified to loci in or near genes that generally were not expected to be associated with blood pressure or essential hypertension; more significant variants will be discovered when even larger and more refined studies become available. this article gives a short introduction to gwas and summarizes the current findings for blood pressure and hypertension.","Among the reasons put forward to explain the difficulty in identifying genes for blood pressure and hypertension are theoretical considerations suggesting that the power of linkage studies is low for variants with modest effects . These genomic tools permit the interrogation of a large proportion of the common human genetic variation throughout the genome, a task that previously was not feasible. For many years, hypertension genetics has been dominated by the stark contrast between the high heritability of blood pressure and hypertensive traits and the frustrating reality that no clearly reproducible genetic variant for essential hypertension could be found.The genome wide significance level is set at 5 108 and plotted as the dotted line. The most significant SNP in this experiment is colored in red (rs2681492 in the ATP2B1 gene).

These investigations will help in better understanding of the genetics of blood pressure and hypertension, with potential benefits for prediction, diagnosis, and treatment . Further GWAS on alternative phenotypes (eg, pulse pressure and mean arterial pressure) and on refined phenotypes (eg, long term average blood pressure) are expected to appear soon.","Among the reasons put forward to explain the difficulty in identifying genes for blood pressure and hypertension are theoretical considerations suggesting that the power of linkage studies is low for variants with modest effects .

408,"normal progression through the cell cycle requires the sequential action of cyclin dependent kinases cdk1, cdk2, cdk4 and cdk6. direct or indirect deregulation of cdk activity is a feature of almost all cancers, and has led to the development of cdk inhibitors as anti cancer agents. the cdk activating kinase (cak) plays a critical role in regulating cell cycle by mediating the activating phosphorylation of cdk1, cdk2, cdk4 and cdk6. as such, cdk7, which also regulates transcription as part of the tfiih basal transcription factor, is an attractive target for the development of anti cancer drugs. computer modelling of the cdk7 structure was used to design potential potent cdk7 inhibitors. here, we show that a pyrazolo[1, 5a]pyrimidine derived compound, bs 181, inhibited cak activity with an ic50=21 nm. testing of other cdks, as well as another kinases showed that bs 181 only inhibited cdk2 at concentrations lower than m, with cdk2 being inhibited 35 fold less potently (ic50=750 nm) than cdk7. in mcf 7 cells, bs 181 inhibited the phosphorylation of cdk7 substrates, promoted cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, to inhibit the growth of cancer cell lines and showed anti tumor effects in vivo. the drug was stable in vivo with a plasma elimination half life in mice of min after intraperitoneal administration of mg/kg. the same dose of drug inhibited the growth of mcf 7 human xenografts in nude mice. bs 181 therefore provides the first example of a potent and selective cdk7 inhibitor with potential as an anti cancer agent.","CDKs are the catalytic subunits of a large family of serine/threonine protein kinases.

412,"the release of neurotransmitters and hormones from secretory vesicles plays a fundamental role in the function of the nervous system including neuronal communication. high throughput testing of drugs modulating transmitter release is becoming an increasingly important area in the fields of cell biology, neurobiology, and neurology. carbon fiber amperometry, provides high resolution measurements of amount and time course of transmitter release from single vesicles, and their modulation by drugs and molecular manipulations. however, such methods do not allow the rapid collection of data from a large number of cells. to allow such testing, we have developed a cmos potentiostat circuit that can be scaled to a large array. in this paper, we present two post cmos fabrication methods to incorporate the electrochemical electrode material. we demonstrate by proof of principle the feasibility of on chip electrochemical measurements of dopamine, and catecholamine release from adrenal chromaffin cells. the measurement noise is consistent with the typical electrode noise in recordings with external amplifiers. the electronic noise of the potentiostat in recordings with s integration time is ~0.11 pa and is negligible compared to the inherent electrode noise.","In response to specific signals, many eukaryotic cells release pre formed molecules packaged into secretory vesicles that fuse with the plasma membrane and release their contents into the extracellular space.

413,"a wireless sensor based on the magnetoelastic, magnetically soft ferromagnetic alloy was constructed for remote measurement of pressure in flowing fluids. the pressure sensor was a rectangular strip of ferromagnetic alloy fe40ni38mo4b18 adhered on a solid polycarbonate substrate and protected by a thin polycarbonate film. upon excitation of a time varying magnetic field through an excitation coil, the magnetically soft sensor magnetized and produced higher order harmonic fields, which were detected through a detection coil. under varying pressures, the sensor's magnetoelastic property caused a change in its magnetization, altering the amplitudes of the higher order harmonic fields. a theoretical model was developed to describe the effect of pressure on the sensor's higher order harmonic fields. experimental observations showed the 2nd order harmonic field generated by the pressure sensor was correlated to the surrounding fluid pressure, consistent with the theoretical results. furthermore, it was demonstrated that the sensor exhibited good repeatability and stability with minimal drift. sensors with smaller dimensions were shown to have greater sensitivity but lower pressure range as compared to their larger counterparts. since the sensor signal was also dependent on the location of the sensor with respect to the excitation/detection coil, a calibration algorithm was developed to eliminate signal variations due to the changing sensor location. because of its wireless and passive nature, this sensor is useful for continuous and long term monitoring of pressure at inaccessible areas. for example, sensors with these capabilities are suitable to be used in biomedical applications where permanent implantation and long term monitoring are needed.","Similarly, the same principle was applied for the construction of a liquid flow sensor .

419,"previous studies have shown that sensations of burning, stinging or pricking can be evoked by warming or cooling the skin to innocuous temperatures (low threshold thermal nociception; ltn) below the thresholds of cold and heat sensitive nociceptors. ltn implies that some primary afferent fibers classically defined as warm and cold fibers relay stimulation to the nociceptive system. we addressed this question in humans by determining if different adaptation temperatures (at) and rates of temperature change would affect thermal sensation and ltn similarly. in exp. subjects rated the intensity of warmth, cold and nociceptive sensations produced by increasing steps in temperature (0.5c increments) from ats of 35, 33, 31c for cooling and 30, 32, 34c for heating. depending upon at, thresholds for nociceptive and thermal sensations estimated from the rating data differed by as little as 1.0 for cooling and +1.5 for heating. thresholds of thermal and nociceptive sensations shifted by similar amounts across the ats during cooling, whereas during heating the nociceptive threshold was significantly affected only between ats of and 34c. in exp. 2, increasing the rate of temperature change from 0.5/sec to 4.0/sec increased the intensity of thermal and nociceptive sensations significantly, but the effect was greatest for nociceptive sensations during heating. the results of both experiments are consistent with mediation of ltn by low threshold thermoreceptors, although ltn caused by heating may depend on a subset of fibers that express less sensitive trp channels than those that serve sensations of warmth at the mildest temperatures.","Electrophysiological support for this hypothesis has come from studies of spinal (; ; ; ), trigeminal and thalamic neurons that respond to innocuous cooling or warming as well as to nociceptive thermal, chemical, or mechanical stimuli.

While our method requires a priori knowledge that the tissues are diamagnetic, experience shows that human tissues are diamagnetic, typically lying within 20% of the susceptibility of H2O .The enhanced MNP sensitivity of 27 g/g or ~2 nM corresponds to ~600 MNPs per 10 m diameter cell volume. The toxicity of these MNPs during topical administration is not known, however, the concentration of MNPs needed to track MNP diffusion may be considerably lower than the 4 mg/g used in this study .

423,the use of a rhodium(ii) carboxylate catalyst enables the mild and stereoselective formation of carbazoles from biaryl azides. intramolecular competition experiments of triaryl azides suggested the source of the selectivity. a primary intramolecular kinetic isotope effect was not observed and correlation of the product ratios with hammett + values produced a plot with two intersecting lines with opposite values. these data suggest that electronic donation by the biaryl system accelerates the formation of rhodium nitrenoid and that cn bond formation occurs through a 4 electron 5 atom electrocyclization.,",, If rhodium nitrenoid 8 behaved similarly to 7, the electronic nature of the aryl substituents would influence the mechanism of N heterocycle formation through stabilization of the quinoid resonance structure 9.

424,"current chemotherapy regimens against pancreatic cancer are met with little success as poor tumor vascularization significantly limits the delivery of oncological drugs. high dose targeted drug delivery, through which a drug delivery vehicle releases a large payload upon tumor localization, is thus a promising alternative strategy against this lethal disease. herein, we synthesize anti cea half antibody conjugated lipid polymer hybrid nanoparticles and characterize their ligand conjugation yields, physicochemical properties, and targeting ability against pancreatic cancer cells. under the same drug loading, the half antibody targeted nanoparticles show enhanced cancer killing effect compared to the corresponding non targeted nanoparticles.","For instance, the large hydrodynamic size of antibodies significantly increases nonspecific uptake by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) and reduces the NP circulation half life. diabodies, and minibodies, have emerged in research settings to address these issues.

425,"this work examines how mechanical signals affect the barrier function and stability of engineered human microvessels in microfluidic type i collagen gels. constructs that were exposed to chronic low flow displayed high permeabilities to bovine serum albumin and kda dextran, numerous focal leaks, low size selectivity, and short lifespan of less than one week. higher flows promoted barrier function and increased longevity; at the highest flows, the barrier function rivaled that observed in vivo, and all vessels survived to day 14. by studying the physiology of microvessels of different geometries, we established that shear stress and transmural pressure were the dominant mechanical signals that regulated barrier function and vascular stability, respectively. in microvessels that were exposed to high flow, elevation of intracellular cyclic amp further increased the selectivity of the barrier and strongly suppressed cell proliferation. computational models that incorporated stress dependence successfully predicted vascular phenotype. our results indicate that the mechanical microenvironment plays a major role in the functionality and stability of engineered human microvessels in microfluidic collagen gels.","We used three vascular configurations in these experiments: Moreover, since we recently showed that elevation of intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) partially normalized the function of engineered vessels , we studied whether the co presence of cAMP elevating agents and mechanical factors led to synergistic improvements in vascular phenotype . In these tissues, sustained breakdown of the vascular barrier can lead to edema, which results in inappropriate interstitial forces and flows that compromise the health of surrounding parenchyma .Vessels that were grown under low flow (Q = 0.37 0.05 mL/hr) displayed short, non uniform expression of VE cadherin at cellular junctions; segments of staining averaged 18.8 0.7 m in length. In vessels that were parallel with bare channels, we expected the presence of the bare channel to increase pressure within the surrounding gel and thus minimize strain in the neighboring vessel . Delamination near vessel outlets did not interfere with viability and was not noted .Remarkably, these somewhat simplistic models corroborated essentially all of our experimental findings. As expected, we did not observe any focal leaks in microvessels under either condition.

426,"failure of bone under monotonic and cyclic loading is related to the bone mineral density, the quality of the bone matrix and the evolution of microcracks. the theory of linear elastic fracture mechanics has commonly been applied to describe fracture in bone. evidence is presented that bone failure can be described through a non linear theory of fracture. thereby, deterministic size effects are introduced. concepts of a non linear theory are applied to discern how the interaction among bone matrix constituents (collagen and mineral), microcrack characteristics, and trabecular architecture can create distinctively differences in the fracture resistance at the bone tissue level. the nonlinear model is applied to interpret pre clinical data concerning the effects of anti osteoporotic agents on bone properties. the results show that bisphosphonate (bp) treatments that suppress bone remodeling will change trabecular bone in ways such that the size of the failure process zone relative to the trabecular thickness is reduced. selective estrogen receptor modulators (serms) that suppress bone remodeling will change trabecular bone in ways such that the size of the failure process zone relative to the trabecular thickness is increased. the consequences of these changes are reflected in bone mechanical response and predictions are consistent with experimental observations in the animal model which show that bp treatment is associated with more brittle fracture and microcracks without altering the average length of the cracks, whereas serm treatments lead to a more ductile fracture and mainly increase crack length with a smaller increase in microcrack density. the model suggests that bps may be more effective in cases in which bone mass is very low, whereas serms may be more effective when milder osteoporotic symptoms are present.","Energy dissipation as characterized by 0 is then correlated to the stored elastic energy as characterized by E0, the tissue elastic modulus .

427,"aptamers are oligonucleotides that can bind to various non nucleic acid targets, ranging from proteins to small molecules, with a specificity and affinity comparable to that of antibodies. most aptamer based detection strategies require modification on the aptamer, which could lead to a significant loss in its affinity and specificity to the target. here we reported a generic strategy to design aptamer based optical probes. an unmodified aptamer specific to the target and a fluorogenic competitor complementary to the aptamer are utilized for target recognition and signal generation, respectively. the competitor is a hairpin oligonucleotide with a fluorophore attached on one end and a quencher attached on the other. when no target is present, the competitor binds to the aptamer. however, when the target is introduced, the competitor will be displaced from the aptamer by the target, thus resulting in a target specific decrease in fluorescence signal. successful application of this strategy to different types of targets (small molecules and proteins) as well as different types of aptamers (dna and rna) has been demonstrated. furthermore, a thermodynamics based prediction model was established to further rationalize the optimization process. due to its rapidness and simplicity, this aptamer based detection strategy holds great promise in high throughput applications.","Aptamers are oligonucleotides that can bind tightly and specifically to various molecular targets ranging from proteins to small molecules.

429,"isoguanine (2 oxo 6 amino guanine), a natural but non standard base, exhibits unique self association properties compared to its isomer, guanine, and results in formation of different higher order dna structures. in this work, the higher order structures formed by oligonucleotides containing guanine repeats or isoguanine repeats after annealing in solutions containing various cations are evaluated by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (esi ms) and circular dichroism (cd) spectroscopy. the guanine containing strand (g9) consistently formed quadruplexes upon annealing, whereas the isoguanine strand (ig9) formed both pentaplexes and quadruplexes depending on the annealing cation. quadruplex formation with g9 showed some dependence on the identity of the cation present during annealing with high relative quadruplex formation detected with six of ten cations. analogous annealing experiments with ig9 resulted in complex formation with all ten cations, and the majority of the resulting complexes were pentaplexes. cd results indicated most of the original complexes survived the desalting process necessary for esi ms analysis. in addition, several complexes, especially the pentaplexes, were found to be capable of cation exchange with ammonium ions. ab initio calculations were conducted for isoguanine tetrads and pentads coordinated with all ten cations to predict the most energetically stable structures of the complexes in the gas phase. the observed preference of forming quadruplexes versus pentaplexes as a function of the coordinated cation can be interpreted by the calculated reaction energies of both the tetrads and pentads in combination with the distortion energies of tetrads.","Quadruplexes have been studied extensively due to their role in halting both the immortalization of cells and tumor growth by preventing the binding of telomerase, a key enzyme responsible for the elongation of DNA. Both monovalent and divalent cations can support the formation of quadruplexes from guanine rich strands. Circular dichroism (CD) is also an established technique for studying biomolecular structures, including guanine quadruplexes in which the stacking of guanine bases affords strong optical activity.Both G9 and Ig9 were annealed in a similar manner. This basis set, which utilizes effective core potentials for K+, Rb+, Cs+, Ca2+, Sr2+, and Ba2+, and 6 311G** for the other cations, offers a reasonable balance between efficiency and accuracy in studying complexes containing metallic elements. To estimate the relative complex formation of quadruplexes or pentaplexes from the ESI mass spectra, peak areas of the complexes were summed and divided by the peak areas of the complexes and the free single strands as shown in the following equation: RelativeComplexFormation=PAQorPAPPAQ+PAP+PASS where PAQ and PAP refer to the peak areas of the quadruplex and pentaplex species, respectively, and PASS refers to the peak area of the single strand.The prior measurements for poly(isoguanylic acid) were undertaken in 10 mM sodium chloride. Thus, it appears that the greater charge density of Sr2+ and Ba2+ prevents the inclusion of a third cation in the quadruplex. These results indicate isoguanine complexes could serve as promising support architectures for sensing applications .","Quadruplexes have been studied extensively due to their role in halting both the immortalization of cells and tumor growth by preventing the binding of telomerase, a key enzyme responsible for the elongation of DNA. Both monovalent and divalent cations can support the formation of quadruplexes from guanine rich strands. Circular dichroism (CD) is also an established technique for studying biomolecular structures, including guanine quadruplexes in which the stacking of guanine bases affords strong optical activity.Both G9 and Ig9 were annealed in a similar manner. This basis set, which utilizes effective core potentials for K+, Rb+, Cs+, Ca2+, Sr2+, and Ba2+, and 6 311G** for the other cations, offers a reasonable balance between efficiency and accuracy in studying complexes containing metallic elements.

430,"introduction keloids are a common form of pathologic wound healing characterized by excessive production of extracellular matrix. the unfolded protein response (upr) is a cellular response to hypoxia, a component of the wound microenvironment, capable of protecting cells from the effects of over accumulation of misfolded proteins. since keloids have hypersecretion of extracellular matrix, we hypothesized that keloid fibroblasts (kfs) may have enhanced activation of the upr compared to normal fibroblasts (nfs). methods kfs and nfs were placed in a hypoxia chamber for 0, 24, and hrs. we also used tunicamycin to specifically up regulate the upr. upr activation was assayed by pcr for xbp 1 splicing and by immunoblotting with specific antibodies for the three upr transducers. nuclear localization of xbp 1 protein in kfs was confirmed by immunofluorescence. results there is increased activation of xbp 1 protein in kfs compared to nfs following exposure to hypoxia. perk and atf 6, two other pathways activated by the upr, show comparable activation between kfs and nfs. we confirmed that there is enhanced activation of xbp 1 by demonstrating increased nuclear localization of xbp 1 using immunofluorescence. conclusion in contrast to our initial hypothesis that keloids would have broad activation of the upr, we demonstrate here that there is a specific up regulation of one facet of the upr response. this may represent a specific molecular defect in kfs compared to nfs, and also suggests modulation of the upr can be used in wound healing therapy.","The UPR serves to protect the cell from this by affecting cellular transcription and translation to counteract the cellular stresses and to prevent apoptosis, although under more severe or prolonged stress, it can trigger cellular apoptosis. , The resulting signaling leads to diverse transcriptional responses depending upon the tissue type, but are believed to be generally protective.

438,"slip induced fall accidents continue to be a significant cause of fatal injuries and economic losses. identifying the risk factors causing slip induced falls is key to developing better preventive measures to reduce fall accidents. although epidemiological studies suggest localised muscle fatigue may be one of the risk factors for slip induced falls, there has been no documented biomechanical study examining the relationship between fatigue and fall accidents. as such, the overall objective of the current study was to investigate the effects of localised muscle fatigue of the quadriceps on the slip initiation and slip recovery phases of slip induced falls. sixteen healthy, young participants were recruited to walk across a vinyl floor surface in two different sessions (fatigue and no fatigue). kinematic and kinetic data were collected using a 3 d motion analysis system and force plates during both sessions. results suggest that localised muscle fatigue of the quadriceps affected various kinematic and kinetic gait variables that are linked with a higher risk of slip induced falls. additionally, the results indicated that localised muscle fatigue of the knee extensor muscle caused a delayed response in producing an effective joint moment and base of support using the trailing limb to recover from a fall. the findings from this study indicate that localised muscle fatigue is a potential risk factor causing slip induced falls.","The improved understanding of the relationship between LMF and slip outcome will enhance the ability to: Slip and fall related injuries and fatalities continue to pose a significant burden to industry, both in terms of human suffering and economic losses.

439,"cytoplasmic lipid droplets (lds) are organelles in which cells store neutral lipids for use as an energy source in times of need, but they also play important roles in the regulation of key metabolic processes. although lds are essential for normal cell function, excess accumulation of intracellular lipid is associated with several metabolic diseases, including obesity, type diabetes, and atherosclerosis. the function of lds is regulated by their associated proteins, including the members of the pat family: perilipin, adipophilin/adipose differentiationrelated protein, tail interacting protein 47, s3 12, and oxpat/myocardial ld protein/lipid storage droplet protein 5. in this review we discuss the pat proteins in two cardiovascular contexts: 1) in the atherosclerotic vessel wall, where lds within macrophage foam cells store cholesteryl esters derived from modified lipoproteins, and 2) in the myocardium, where lds store fatty acids, the major energy substrate for normal heart function, as triglyceride.","The remaining two mammalian family members are S3 12 and OXPAT. Consistent with this model, perilipin knockout mice have increased basal lipolysis but reduced stimulated lipolysis in isolated adipocytes and in the whole animal .

443,"current research into the function of carbonic anhydrases in cell physiology emphasizes the role of membrane bound carbonic anhydrases, such as carbonic anhydrase ix that has been identified in malignant tumors and is associated with extracellular acidification as a response to hypoxia. we present here a mass spectrometric method to determine the extent to which total carbonic anhydrase activity is due to extracellular carbonic anhydrase in whole cell preparations. the method is based on the biphasic rate of depletion of 18o from co2 measured by membrane inlet mass spectrometry. the slopes of the biphasic depletion are a sensitive measure of the presence of carbonic anhydrase outside and inside of the cells. this property is demonstrated here using suspensions of human red cells in which external carbonic anhydrase was added to the suspending solution. it is also applied to breast and prostate cancer cells which both express exofacial carbonic anhydrase ix. inhibition of external carbonic anhydrase is achieved by use of a membrane impermeant inhibitor that was synthesized for this purpose, p aminomethylbenzenesulfonamide attached to a polyethyleneglycol polymer.","Molecules passing across the membrane enter a mass spectrometer to provide sensitive and real time detection.

463,"objective randomized clinical trials of novel critical care interventions are currently tested in children only after documenting their safety in adults. although this practice may protect children from research risks, it may paradoxically threaten childrens well being by depriving them of evidence to guide their care. we sought to evaluate the ethical, methodologic, and practical arguments for and against studying critical care interventions in adults and children simultaneously rather than sequentially. data source empirical studies and conceptual arguments germane to the objective were reviewed. data extraction and synthesis children are traditionally viewed as participants of last resort due to their vulnerability and decisional incapacity. however, critically ill adults commonly share similar features. thus, structured risk assessments used by institutional review boards to determine the adequacy of research protections for critically ill adults can also help protect children. from a methodologic perspective, interventions may be tested simultaneously in children and adults by enrolling children as a prespecified subgroup within a larger adult randomized clinical trial or by enrolling children in a separate trial conducted in parallel. both approaches raise practical and analytical challenges that can frequently be met. for example, investigators might choose outcome measures that are appropriate for both adults and children. additionally, using bayesian approaches to link the estimates of treatment effects in children to the values observed in adults may enhance the statistical power to detect pediatric specific effects. finally, centralized institutional review boards and data monitoring centers may alleviate practical concerns with conducting trials among adults and children simultaneously. conclusions the current standard of testing critical care interventions in adults before children rests on tenuous ethical arguments and is entrenched by the methodologic and logistic barriers encountered with alternative approaches. however, these barriers will frequently be surmountable. we therefore propose that the default paradigm be changed such that interventions are examined routinely in critically ill children and adults simultaneously unless unique reasons exist to the contrary.","In this article, we suggest that the default paradigm for critical care RCTs ought to be changed so that investigators and Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) are obliged to design and approve studies that include children and adults simultaneouslyin either the same trial or in separate but parallel trialsunless specific reasons exist to the contrary . However, this approach, combined with several practical difficulties in recruiting sufficient numbers of children to RCTs (, ), impedes the generation of pediatric evidence and thus paradoxically places all children at risk . However, many interventions in critical care fall outside of such regulatory review because they involve management strategies rather than drugs.Instead, investigators should strive to detect heterogeneity when it exists by exploring prespecified treatment by age group interactions . For example, among patients without severe co morbidities, mortality rates from sepsis do not begin to increase until patients are >40 years . Third, because the majority of critically ill children are cared for in specialized pediatric hospitals, enrolling children will often require more study sites than would be needed for adults alone.To begin achieving these goals, investigators must recognize their duties to include children in properly selected RCTs of novel critical care interventions, rather than seeking exclusions from existing laws and guidelines. In addition, IRBs must support investigators initiatives to enroll children in critical care trials without first requiring determination of safety and efficacy in adults. Using the methods discussed in this essay, investigators may more rapidly produce definitive pediatric evidence while at the same time minimizing the overall number of children exposed to research.","In this article, we suggest that the default paradigm for critical care RCTs ought to be changed so that investigators and Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) are obliged to design and approve studies that include children and adults simultaneouslyin either the same trial or in separate but parallel trialsunless specific reasons exist to the contrary .

465,"little is known regarding the involvement of the ventral pallidum (vp) in cocaine seeking behavior, in contrast with considerable documentation of the involvement of its major afferent, the nucleus accumbens, over the past thirty years utilizing electrophysiology, lesion, inactivation, molecular, imaging, and other approaches. the vp is neuroanatomically positioned to integrate signals projected from the nucleus accumbens, basolateral amygdala, and ventral tegmental area. in turn, vp projects to thalamoprefrontal, subthalamic, and mesencephalic dopamine regions having widespread influence across mesolimbic, mesocortical, and nigrostriatal systems. prior lesion studies have implicated vp in cocaine seeking behavior, but the electrophysiological mechanisms underlying this behavior in the vp have not been investigated. in the present investigation, following two weeks of training over which animals increased drug intake, vp phasic activity comprised rapid phasic increases or decreases in firing rate during the seconds prior to and/or following cocaine reinforced responses, similar to those found in accumbens. as a population, the direction (increasing or decreasing) and magnitude of firing rate changes were normally distributed suggesting that ventral striatopallidal processing is heterogeneous. since changes in firing rate around the self administering lever press occurred in animals that escalated drug intake prior to neuronal recordings, a marker of addiction like behavior in the rat, the present experiment provides novel support for a role of vp in drug seeking behavior. this is especially important given that pallidothalamic and pallidomesencephalic vp projections are positioned to alter dopaminoceptive targets such as the medial prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, and dorsal striatum, all of which have roles in cocaine self administration.","In turn, the VP predominantly projects to the mediodorsal (MD) thalamus, which influences the medial prefrontal cortex (; ; ).

466,"summary aspergillus fumigatus is a saprophytic fungus commonly found in soil and compost piles. in immunocompromised patients it takes on a sinister form as a potentially lethal opportunistic human pathogen. we currently have a limited understanding of the in vivo growth mechanisms used by a. fumigatus during invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (ipa). the ability of a. fumigatus to adapt to various microenvironments encountered during growth in the human host may explain why a. fumigatus is the most frequently occurring opportunistic pathogenic mold. the transcriptional and metabolic responses to changing microenvironments found in the mammalian lung require the activation of pathways implicated in resistance to unique stresses. thus, the production of primary metabolites in vivo may give clues to the critical pathways used by a. fumigatus to cause disease in human hosts. we recently have identified primary metabolites in the mammalian lung typically associated with fungal growth under hypoxic environments suggesting that a. fumigatus may encounter low oxygen tensions during ipa. these and other studies on a. fumigatus metabolism are the focus of this review.","Mammalian organisms present a broad variety of microenvironments in which A. fumigatus must survive to cause disease. Its primary ecological function is to recycle carbon and nitrogen through the environment [ ]. It has been proposed that A. fumigatus possess unique virulence factors, which allow it to cause disease, but arguably no unique A. fumigatus virulence factor has been discovered.In both cases, full virulence could be restored by complementing the mutant gene or by supplementing the drinking water of the animals with the missing amino acid. SREBPs directly activate the expression of more than 30 genes dedicated to the synthesis and uptake of cholesterol, fatty acids, triglycerides and phospholipids . The sensor kinase detects the accumulation of uncharged tRNA molecules, which is a sign for amino acid depletion.Recently it was shown that the MIC for Amphotericin B was reduced under hypoxic conditions, indicating the importance of understanding microenvironments found in vivo during IPA . The host environment, for example, can play an important role in determining the efficacy of antifungal drugs. Moreover, targeting unique microbial respiration pathways has already been observed to be an effective antimicrobial strategy.","Mammalian organisms present a broad variety of microenvironments in which A. fumigatus must survive to cause disease.

470,"a previous study from our laboratory demonstrated the presence within the rat striatum of dopaminergic terminals in different dynamical states, determined at least in part by the extent to which terminals are subject to autoinhibition. the present study is designed to test the hypothesis that heterogeneity in the basal tonic extracellular dopamine concentration contributes to the variable extent of autoinhibition. we probed basal extracellular dopamine concentrations using a previously demonstrated strategy that utilizes intrastriatal microinfusion of kynurenate, a substance that according to voltammetric measurements decreases extracellular dopamine from its basal concentration. in the striatum, however, we find that the response to kynurenate infusion is itself heterogeneous, allowing a broad classification of sites within the striatum as kynurenate insensitive and kynurenate sensitive, respectively. these newly identified kynurenate insensitive and sensitive sites yield substantially and significantly different evoked da release as measured by voltammetry during electrical stimulation of the medial forebrain bundle. our findings confirm the hypothesis that heterogeneity in the local basal concentration of da is responsible for the variable extent of autoinhibition within the striatum and support the conclusion the steady state and dynamical components of extracellular da in this brain region are coupled.","In a recent review, Schultz pointed out that DA functions can be divided approximately between those involving rapid changes in extracellular DA concentrations (sub seconds to seconds) and slow changes (minutes to tens of minutes) .

471,"objectives to explore the impact of adjusting for income and education on disparities in functional limitations and limitations in activities of daily living (adls) between black and white older americans. method data from the american community survey were used to examine the associations of education and income, stratified by race and gender, with functional limitations and adls, in a sample of 16,870 non hispanic blacks and 186,086 non hispanic whites aged to 74. sequential logistic regressions were used to examine the relative contribution of income and education to racial disparities. results ninety percent of the blackwhite difference in disability rates for men and 75% of the difference for women aged to were explained by income and education. discussion the greatly elevated risk of disability among blacks aged to is largely explained by differences in socioeconomic status. reductions in blackwhite health disparities require a better understanding of the mechanisms whereby lower income and education are associated with functional outcomes in older persons.","With its large sample size and high response rate (96.7%), the ACS offers an opportunity to examine this topic within the context of a nationally representative sample of older persons far larger than that typically used in such research. Furthermore, an explicit assessment of the joint distribution of race and SES (e.g., multiplicative modeling) and an examination of several types of disability is required .

472,"the dynamics of sway during quiet stance have often been approximated by the movement of an unstable inverted pendulum. controlling this unstable load requires the nervous system to balance the reliance on feed forward volitional activation and feedback mechanisms such as stretch reflexes. it has been demonstrated that reflex excitability is heightened when postural stability is threatened by destabilizing forces in the environment. however, the relationship between postural stability, volitional activation, and stretch reflex excitability remains unclear. we addressed this question by characterizing feed forward and feedback activation strategies during balance of a simulated inverted pendulum. we hypothesized that feed forward co contraction and stretch reflex amplitude would scale together as the external support provided by the environment was reduced. electromyographic (emg) responses in muscles of the lower limb were used to characterize co contraction patterns and stretch reflex amplitude as subjects stabilized the simulated loads. our results revealed that co contraction magnitude did indeed scale with increasingly destabilizing torques; however reflex amplitude was attenuated as stability was reduced. these findings suggest that the contribution of feedback mechanisms to postural stability depends on both the level of stability provided by the environment and how the environment influences the pattern of volitional activation.","Evidence from studies in the upper limb has suggested that both feedback and feed forward strategies vary in a task specific manner. Hence, there remains a discrepancy regarding the relative contributions of feed forward and feedback strategies during postural control . Maintenance of stance requires minimal effort despite the fact that the nervous system must account for the complex multi segmental dynamics of the body.Regulation of Feed forward and Feedback Strategies at the Human Ankle during Balance Control 19965100 Stretch reflex amplitude varied with the level of external support provided by the environment. From these data it is clear that reflex amplitude was significantly attenuated in Sol, MG, LG, and PL during interaction with the most unstable load. The relative reduction in reflex amplitude for the U2 condition ranged from 6.9% in LG to 27.6% in PL when compared to the stiff condition.Although the dorsiflexion torque produced by TA could be balanced by the plantar flexors, the co activation of TA and PL may serve to balance torques produced in the frontal plane as well . However, this strategy appears to be sensitive to nature of ongoing motor activity. Reflex onset was defined as the time following movement onset when the EMG exceeded three standard deviations above the average baseline activity for 5 ms. Reflex amplitude was then computed by calculating the mean amplitude of the averaged, rectified EMG during the 20ms following response onset.","Evidence from studies in the upper limb has suggested that both feedback and feed forward strategies vary in a task specific manner.

473,"summary spatial cluster detection is an important methodology for identifying regions with excessive numbers of adverse health events without making strong model assumptions on the underlying spatial dependence structure. previous work has focused on point or individual level outcome data and few advances have been made when the outcome data are reported at an aggregated level, e.g. at the county or census tract level. this paper proposes a new class of spatial cluster detecion methods for point or aggregate data, comprising of continuous, binary, and count data. compared with the existing spatial cluster detection methods it has the following advantages. first, it readily incorporates region specific weights, for example, based on a regions population or a regions outcome variance, which is key for aggregate data. second, the established general framework allows for area level and individual level covariate adjustment. a simulation study is conducted to evaluate the performance of the method. the proposed method is then applied to assess spatial clustering of high body mass index in a hmo population in the seattle, washington usa area.","Furthermore, even though BMI is a continuous outcome, it is highly skewed with heavier tails at the upward end of the distribution than would be expected if it was normal distributed, i.e. methods assuming a normal assumption are not valid. We conclude with a general discussion in Section 5 . The increasing prevalence of obese/overweight individuals is a growing public health concern, causing a tremendous strain on the health care system.The cumulative residual method is based on how well loc approximates Zloc which requires sufficient sample size (e.g. number of regions). For simplicity we assume a 1010 unit less grid with 100 equally sized square regions. We varied to be 1, 10, 20, and 30 and to be 1, 5, 10, 20, and 30.Further, by flexibly handling differential weighting of observations this method can be applied to a larger array of applications. We ran a small simulation study assessing the Type I error when weights were variable and did not find a large effect on the Type I error. This type of method could be used simultaneously with the proposed method in this paper to assess cross sectional and longitudinal location of spatial clusters over time .","Furthermore, even though BMI is a continuous outcome, it is highly skewed with heavier tails at the upward end of the distribution than would be expected if it was normal distributed, i.e. methods assuming a normal assumption are not valid.

475,"brain computer interfaces (bcis) can use brain signals from the scalp (eeg), the cortical surface (ecog), or within the cortex to restore movement control to people who are paralyzed. like muscle based skills, bci use requires activity dependent adaptations in the brain that maintain stable relationships between the persons intent and the signals that convey it. this study shows that humans can learn over a series of training sessions to use eeg for three dimensional control. the responsible eeg features are focused topographically on the scalp and spectrally in specific frequency bands. people acquire simultaneous control of three independent signals (one for each dimension) and reach targets in a virtual three dimensional space. such bci control in humans has not been reported previously. the results suggest that with further development noninvasive eeg based bcis might control the complex movements of robotic arms or neuroprostheses.","Three dimensional (3 D) control has been reported only for intracortical signals (i.e., neuronal action potentials) in monkeys .

478,"in this paper, we have examined two cysteine modifications resulting from sample preparation for protein characterization by ms: (1) a previously observed conversion of cysteine to dehydroalanine, now found in the case of disulfide mapping and (2) a novel modification corresponding to conversion of cysteine to alanine. using model peptides, the conversion of cysteine to dehydroalanine via elimination of a disulfide bond was seen to result from the conditions of typical tryptic digestion (37 c, ph 7.0 9.0) without disulfide reduction and alkylation.. furthermore, the surprising conversion of cysteine to alanine was shown to occur by heating cysteine containing peptides in the presence of a phosphine (tcep). the formation of alanine from cysteine, investigated by performing experiments in h2o or d2o, suggested a radical based desulfurization mechanism unrelated to elimination. importantly, an understanding of the mechanism and conditions favorable for cysteine desulfurization provides insight for the establishment of improved sample preparation procedures of protein analysis.","For example, disulfide bond formation, due to the oxidation of pairs of cysteines, is critical for protein folding and maintaining three dimensional structures.

485,"amphiphilic block copolymers of suitable proportions can self assemble into surprisingly long and stable worm like micelles, but the intrinsic polydispersity of polymers as well as polymer blending efforts and the increasing use of degradable chains all raise basic questions of curvature composition coupling and morphological stability of these high curvature assemblies. molecular simulations here of polyethylene glycol (peg) based systems show that a systematic increase in the hydrated peg fraction, in both monodisperse and binary blends, induces budding and breakup into spherical and novel dumbbell micelles as seen in electron microscopy images of degradable worm like micelles. core dimension, d, in our large scale, long time dissipative particle dynamics (dpd) simulations is shown to scale with chain length, n, as predicted theoretically by the strong segregation limit (d ~ n2/3), but morphological transitions of binary mixtures are only crudely predicted by simple mixture rules. here we show that for weakly demixing diblock copolymers, the coupling between local interfacial concentration and mean curvature can be described with a simple linear relationship. the computational methods developed here for peg based assemblies should be useful for many high curvature nanosystems.","The simulations here probe general issues underlying the non ergodic behavior of polymer nano assemblies: diffusional timescales for lateral segregation within an assembly, and the coupled interplay of composition and curvature in micellar assemblies . In the latter, we test a common assumption of component additivity and then elaborate the coupling of curvature to component concentration. The range of p allowable for a given morphology is then calculated from core volume and interfacial area [eg. sphere: p=(6d3)(d2lc)1=013], and the cylinder shaped worm like micelle proves by such determinations to have a 23 fold narrower range of p(=1312) compared to either spherical micelles or vesicle bilayers (p=121).Undulations develop Arrows in the bottom image highlight breakup events. The random starting configuration of the coronaFlexibility of the worm micelle before break up can be determined from careful modeling of curvature driven segregation and seems consistent with experiment. An increase in temperature from ambient (293 K) to a temperature 20% higher (352 K) showed no significant temperature effect on the metastability limit, consistent with experimental phase diagrams for these types of block copolymers .

487,"this article is based on a lecture i presented as the recipient of the pritzker distinguished lecturer award at the biomedical engineering society annual meeting in october 2009. here, i review more than thirty years of research from my laboratory, beginning with studies designed to test the theory that cells use tensegrity (tensional integrity) architecture to stabilize their shape and sense mechanical signals, which i believed to be critical for control of cell function and tissue development. although i was trained as a cell biologist, i found that the tools i had at my disposal were insufficient to experimentally test these theories, and thus i ventured into engineering to find critical solutions. this path has been extremely fruitful as it has led to confirmation of the critical role that physical forces play in developmental control, as well as how cells sense and respond to mechanical signals at the molecular level through a process known as cellular mechanotransduction. many of the predictions of the cellular tensegrity model relating to cell mechanical behaviors have been shown to be valid, and this vision of cell structure led to discovery of the central role that transmembrane adhesion receptors, such as integrins, and the cytoskeleton play in mechanosensing and mechanochemical conversion. in addition, these fundamental studies have led to significant unexpected technology fallout, including development of micromagnetic actuators for non invasive control of cellular signaling, microfluidic systems as therapeutic extracorporeal devices for sepsis therapy, and new dna based nanobiotechnology approaches that permit construction of artificial tensegrities that mimic properties of living materials for applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.","To me, this is one of the greatest messages I can convey to young faculty: remember that you can learn as much (or more) from your students, as they can learn from you.

Thus, I dedicate this lecture to all of the biomedical engineering students and fellows whom I have trained over the course of my career .However, cells also anchor to the ECM substrate through multiple small discrete tethering sites, known as focal adhesions, which function much like tent pegs. By focusing light generated by a femtosecond laser through a microscope objective, we could effectively generate the heat of the sun within a tiny volume for an incredibly short time (1015 s), thereby vaporizing all molecules located within this location. For example, we showed that applying shear or tension to integrin bound magnetic beads stimulates the entire cAMP signaling cascade, as measured by activation of large heterotrimeric G proteins within the focal adhesions, increased production of cAMP by adenylyl cyclase, enhanced nuclear translocation of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A, activation of the transcription factor CREB, and induction of reporter gene transcription driven by multiple cAMP response elements.I hope that I fully communicated the challenges I have faced as a biologist who believed that mechanics and structure are as important regulators of cell and tissue function as chemicals and genes. In order to do interdisciplinary research and pursue unconventional ideas successfully, it is necessary to demonstrate to ones critics that you can use the same approaches they do, and obtain the same results.

488,"previous investigations of somatic hypersensitivity in ibs patients have typically involved only a single stimulus modality, and little information exists regarding whether patterns of somatic pain perception vary across stimulus modalities within a group of patients with ibs. therefore, the current study was designed to characterize differences in perceptual responses to a battery of noxious somatic stimuli in ibs patients compared to controls. a total of diarrhea predominant and controls participated in the study. we evaluated pain threshold and tolerance and sensory and affective ratings of contact thermal, mechanical pressure, ischemic stimuli, and cold pressor stimuli. in addition to assessing perceptual responses, we also evaluated differences in neuroendocrine and cardiovascular responses to these experimental somatic pain stimuli. a subset of ibs patients demonstrated the presence of somatic hypersensitivity to thermal, ischemic, and cold pressor nociceptive stimuli. the somatic hypersensitivity in ibs patients was somatotopically organized in that the lower extremities that share viscerosomatic convergence with the colon demonstrate the greatest hypersensitivity. there were also changes in acth, cortisol, and systolic blood pressure in response to the ischemic pain testing in ibs patients when compared to controls. the results of this study suggest that a more widespread alteration in central pain processing in a subset of ibs patients may be present as they display hypersensitivity to heat, ischemic, and cold pressor stimuli.","Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder that is estimated to affect up to 20% of the US population.

Many patients with IBS also exhibit a wide variety of somatic symptoms including back pain, migraine headaches, heartburn, dyspareunia, and muscle pain in body regions somatotopically distinct from the gut.This suggests that different mechanisms may play a role in the hypersensitivity seen with diverse nociceptive pain stimuli as the IBS patients with a history of the greatest number of extraintestinal symptoms had the highest overlap of sensitivity to nociceptive stimuli. Future studies are needed to: (1) determine if the same findings of somatic hypersensitivity are also present in IBS patients with constipation or alternating bowel patterns; (2) examine the molecular mechanisms that may lead to somatic hypersensitivity in these IBS patients . It is interesting that the subsets of IBS patients with thermal, ischemic, and cold pressor hypersensitivity had minimal overlap between groups .A total of 144 participants were recruited for entry into this study. Some of the IBS patients included in the study had a history of extraintestinal symptoms, however, they were all free from acute abdominal pain and/or extraintestinal symptoms during the day of the sensory testing .

489,"purpose of review skin cancer incidence is higher than that of any other human malignancy, and yet one of its root causes (ultraviolet radiation) is perhaps better understood than any other human carcinogen. the roles of ultraviolet radiation exposure and indoor tanning behaviors on skin cancer risk are explored here. recent findings studies from the past several years have shown a significant association between ever use of an indoor tanning facility and an increased risk of basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma. the association between indoor tanning and skin cancer is particularly strong among those who first used a tanning facility in early adulthood. elevated vitamin d levels have been suggested to protect against various internal malignancies and other disease states, but sources of vitamin d that do not require uv exposure are easily available. summary although additional research is needed to understand fully the relationship between uv and skin cancer, it is already clear that indoor tanning bed use represents an avoidable risk factor for melanoma and non melanoma skin cancer both of which may be lethal. acting upon this information provides a unique opportunity for protecting the public health.","The advertisement continued: Recent research indicates that the benefits of moderate exposure to sunlight outweigh the hypothetical risks. Scientists have proven, however, that exposure to all forms of ultraviolet light both indoors and out stimulates the natural production of vitamin D. And research has proven that vitamin D protects against heart disease and many types of cancer, in addition to providing other important health benefits. It's time to rethink sun bathing .For example, in a case control study from Germany involving 710 lymphoma patients and an equal number of controls, increased number of vacation days spent at sunny locations was associated with a decreased risk of developing lymphoma (OR = 0.6, 95% CI = 0.4 0.8) . Similarly, total hours of sun exposure per week had a weak negative association with non Hodgkin lymphoma risk among individuals living in Nebraska . Some of the strongest epidemiological evidence supporting an association between vitamin D levels and cancer mortality comes from the study of colon cancer.These results reinforce the importance of vitamin D to overall health, but they do not imply that intentional UV exposure is necessary for attaining optimal vitamin D levels. While frequent indoor tanning can be associated with elevated serum vitamin D, non carcinogenic alternatives such as dietary intake and oral supplements should be preferentially considered . Given the high prevalence of indoor and outdoor tanning, especially among younger individuals, it is a public health imperative to educate the general population about associated risks and set in place opportunities to utilize this information to more effectively prevent skin cancer .","The advertisement continued: Recent research indicates that the benefits of moderate exposure to sunlight outweigh the hypothetical risks.

495,"addition of iron salts to chaotrope denatured aporubredoxin (apord) leads to nearly quantitative recovery of its single fe(scys)4 site and native protein structure without significant dilution of the chaotrope. this high chaotrope approach was used to examine iron binding and protein folding events using stopped flow uv/vis absorption and cd spectroscopies. at 100 fold molar excess ferrous iron over denatured apord maintained in m urea, the folded holofeiiird structure was recovered in >90% yield with t1/2 < msec. more modest excesses of iron also gave nearly quantitative holord formation in m urea but with chronological resolution of iron binding and protein folding events. the results indicate structural recovery in m urea consists of the minimal sequence: (1) binding of ferrous iron to the unfolded apord, (2) rapid formation of a near native ferrous fe(scys)4 site within a protein having no detectable secondary structure, (3) recovery of the ferrous fe(scys)4 site chiral environment nearly concomitantly with (4) recovery of the native protein secondary structure. the rate of step (and by inference, step 1) was not saturated even at 100 fold molar excess of iron. analogous results obtained on cysser iron ligand variants support formation of an unfolded fe(scys)3 complex between steps and 2, which we propose is the key nucleation event that pulls distal regions of the protein chain together. these results show that folding of chaotrope denatured apord is iron nucleated and driven by extraordinarily rapid formation of the fe(scys)4 site from an essentially random coil apoprotein. this high chaotrope, multi spectroscopic approach could clarify folding pathways of other [m(scys)3 or 4] containing proteins.","These characteristics include an approximately tetrahedral Fe(SCys)4 site surrounded by a pair of iron ligating CXXC loops sequentially separated from each other by 29 residues, and a beta sheet containing the N and C terminii , The iron site cycles between FeII and FeIII formal oxidation states.

496,"summary gallstone disease is a frequent condition throughout the world and cholesterol stones are the most frequent form in western countries. current standard treatment of symptomatic gallstone subjects remains laparoscopic cholecystectomy. the selection of patients amenable for non surgical, medical therapy is of key importance: a careful analysis should consider the natural history of the disease and the overall costs of therapy. only patients with mild symptoms and small, uncalcified cholesterol gallstones in a functioning gallbladder with a patent cystic duct will be considered for oral litholysis by the hydrophilic ursodeoxycholic acid (udca) hopefully leading to cholesterol desaturation of bile and progressive stone dissolution. recent studies have raised the possibility that cholesterol lowering agents which inhibit hepatic cholesterol synthesis (statins) or intestinal cholesterol absorption (ezetimibe), or drugs acting on specific nuclear receptors involved in cholesterol and bile acid homeostasis may offer, alone or in combination, additional medical therapeutic tools for treating cholesterol gallstones. recent perspectives on medical treatment of cholesterol gallstone disease will be discussed in this chapter.","Furthermore, the prevalence of gallstones seems to be rising and approximately one million new cases are discovered each year .

497,"small vessel pathology and microvascular lesions are no longer considered as minor players in the fields of cognitive impairment and mood regulation. although frequently found in cognitively intact elders, both neuroimaging and neuropathological data revealed the negative impact on cognitive performances of their presence within neocortical association areas, thalamus and basal ganglia. unlike cognition, the relationship between these lesions and mood dysregulation is still a matter of intense debate. early studies focusing on the role of macroinfarct location in the occurrence of post stroke depression (psd) led to conflicting data. later on, the concept of vascular depression proposed a deleterious effect of subcortical lacunes and deep white matter demyelination on mood regulation in elders who experienced the first depressive episode. more recently, the chronic accumulation of lacunes in thalamus, basal ganglia and deep white matter has been considered as a strong correlate of psd. we provide here a critical overview of neuroimaging and neuropathological sets of evidence regarding the affective repercussions of vascular burden in the aging brain and discuss their conceptual and methodological limitations. based on these observations, we propose that the accumulation of small vascular and microvascular lesions constitutes a common neuropathological platform for both cognitive decline and depressive episodes in old age.","The first reports of the impact of vascular lesions on cognitive functions date from 1672, when Thomas Willis (16211675) described, in his book De Anima Brutorum, a series of cases of post apoplexy dementia .

508,"line 1 (l1) retrotransposons represent the most abundant family of non ltr retrotransposons in virtually all mammals. the only currently known exception is platypus, where it is found only in low copy numbers. autonomous l1s encode two proteins, orf1p and orf2p, both of which are required for the transposition of l1s. l1 replicative machinery is also involved in the trans mobilization of non autonomous retrotransposons, such as diverse short interspersed repetitive elements (sines) and processed pseudogenes. here, we focus on a unique category of half l1 elements (hal1s), which encode orf1p but not orf2p. hal1s are present both in placental mammals and marsupials. we demonstrate that hal1s originated independently several times during the evolution of mammals. the youngest mammalian hal1 elements analyzed in this paper were identified in the guinea pig genome. our analysis strongly suggests that hal1 encoded orf1p is essential for the transposition of hal1s and indicates that the evolution of orf1p in hal1s is faster than in l1s. the implications of hal1 for the evolution of l1 elements and the host genomes are discussed.","In addition, by means of template switching L1 can mobilize other types of cellular RNAs, such as U6 snRNA (; ; ).

511,"introduction previously, we have shown in a cross comparison study that multifunctional photopolymerized semi interpenetrating network (sipn) system is an effective donor site treatment in a swine model. the advantages of sipn include spray on application, in situ photopolymerization, and ability to cover large contoured areas. sipn has also been shown to be an effective delivery vehicle for keratinocyte growth factor, dexamethasone, bupivacaine, and silver sulfadiazine in vitro. our aim for this study was to show that these products delivered to the wound bed with sipn would not change the wound healing characteristics compared to the control site through qualitative clinical evaluation and to compare the rate and quality of donor site healing through histologic evaluation. methods eight yucatan swine of 40lbs each were randomly divided into four groups of two pigs prior to surgery. each animal had 5.6 % total body surface area of skin harvested from two different dorsal regions, with one at 22/1000th inch and the other at 30/1000th inch setting on the dermatome. each test site on each animal was then sequentially dressed with cm2 of xeroform gauze, sipn, sipn loaded with 0.5% bupivacaine, or sipn loaded with 1% silver sulfadiazine. sipn with or without soluble drugs were applied as liquid then photopolymerized in situ to form an elastic covering. each of the test areas was separated by cm2 of autograft which was used to divide the test areas. wound assessment and euthanasia occurred at days 7, 9, 14, and days. a full thickness biopsy was taken from each of the study areas for histological analysis. results by days, all areas show complete epidermal coverage histologically. the 30/1000th inch site revealed a thicker, more irregular dermis compared to the 22/1000th site. evaluation of the day sites revealed equal thinning and flattening of the new epidermis. no site showed full restoration of the rete ridges. no signs of infection were seen in clinical or histological evaluations of any treatment. conclusion the addition of bupivacaine and silver sulfadiazine to sipn does not show any alterations in wound healing of a donor site in a swine model when compared with sipn without loaded drugs and a standard control dressing. this efficacy may be coupled with established localized sipn drug delivery profiles and allow further studies to evaluate the efficacy of these drugs to promote healing, eradicate and prevent infection, and manage pain.","Split thickness autograft donor site wounds provide major clinical challenges such as infection, pain, and long healing times. There are many commonly used donor site dressings on the market today including Xeroform (Covidien Inc., Mansfield, MA, USA).

There remains statistically greater lymphocyte density at the 0.022 cut depth compared to the 0.030 depth. This mixture at the dermis clot interface sloughed off following epidermis formation.There were overall no differences in the structures and cells associated with wound healing have been observed among treatment types.

512,"regulatory t cells (treg) express the forkhead box p3 (foxp3) transcription factor and suppress pathological immune responses against self and foreign antigens, including commensal microorganisms. foxp3 has been proposed as a master key regulator for treg, required for their differentiation, maintenance, and suppressive functions. two types of treg have been defined. natural treg (ntreg) are usually considered to be a separate sublineage arising during thymus differentiation. induced treg (itreg) originate upon t cell receptor (tcr) stimulation in the presence of tumor growth factor . although under homeostatic conditions most treg in the periphery are ntreg, special immune challenges in the intestine promote more frequently the generation of itreg. furthermore, recent observations have challenged the notion that treg are a stable sublineage, and they suggest that, particularly under lymphopenic and/or inflammatory conditions, treg may lose foxp3 and/or acquire diverse effector functions, especially in the intestine, which may contribute to uncontrolled inflammation.","Moreover, subsequent studies showed that sustained Foxp3 expression in mature Treg is required for their maintenance and suppressive function. Foxp3 can also be induced post thymically, in conventional mature T lymphocytes when they are activated in vitro or in vivo in the presence of the cytokine tumor growth factor (TGF) . At present, it is neither certain how to distinguish nTreg from iTreg, nor is it established whether nTreg and iTreg can in some circumstances have different biological functions .two types of treg have been defined. These results were confirmed by the analysis of Il 10 mRNA in Rag/ mice without the reporter construct. The Treg will eventually lose Foxp3, however, if IL 10 is not present during the crucial priming events.It is now critical to identify markers for those Foxp3 + cells that are most likely to lose Foxp3 expression, and for those cells that have already lost Foxp3. The assumption underlying this hypothesis, however, is that such hyper expanding iTreg are also less stable. In fact, in our own transfer experiments to lymphopenic mice, the substantial loss of Foxp3 expression and regulatory function required the coordinate action of two factors, namely, the loss of IL 10 signaling to the Treg and the presence of an inflammatory state in the host.","Moreover, subsequent studies showed that sustained Foxp3 expression in mature Treg is required for their maintenance and suppressive function.

513,"binding of pertussis toxin (ptx) was examined by glycan microarray; positive hits fell into four general groups. one group represents sialylated bi antennary compounds with an n glycan core terminating in 2 6 linked sialic acid. the second group consists of multi antennary compounds with a canonical n glycan core, but lacking terminal sialic acids, which represents a departure from previous understanding of ptx binding to n glycans. the third group consists of neu5ac2 3(lactose or n acetyllactosamine) that lack the branched mannose core found in n glycans, thus their presentation is more similar to o linked glycans and glycolipids. the fourth group of compounds consists of neu5ac2 8neu5ac2 8neu5ac, which is seen in the c series gangliosides and some n glycans. quantitative analysis by spr of the relative affinities of ptx for terminal neu5ac2 3 versus neu5ac2 6, as well as the affinities for the trisaccharide neu5ac2 8neu5ac2 8neu5ac versus disaccharide, revealed identical global affinities, even though the amount of bound glycan varied by 4 to 5 fold. these studies suggest that the conformational space occupied by a glycan can play an important role in binding, independent of affinity. characterization of n terminal and c terminal binding sites on the s2 and s3 subunits by mutational analysis revealed that binding to all sialylated compounds was mediated by the c terminal binding sites, and binding to non sialylated n linked glycans is mediated by the n terminal sites present on both the s2 and s3 subunits. a detailed understanding of the glycans recognized by pertussis toxin is essential to understand which cells are targeted in clinical disease.","Additionally, some sites may overlap. Glycoprotein Ib, Mac 1 (CD11b/CD18), CD14, and TLR 4 have been implicated as PTx receptors; however direct binding has only been demonstrated for glycoprotein Ib ( ). It is known that PTx can bind the serum glycoproteins fetuin and haptoglobin, which are used in toxin purification strategies ( ).Comparison of branch differences within the Sialo N group can give insight into the recognition process.

Similarly to aerolysin, which can bind both N glycans and GPI anchored proteins by different domains, PTx also shows an intermediate level of toxicity to Lec1 CHO cells, which lack the N acetylglucosamine transferase required for maturation of complex and hybrid type N glycans from oligomannose type N glycan precursors (, , , ).","Additionally, some sites may overlap. Glycoprotein Ib, Mac 1 (CD11b/CD18), CD14, and TLR 4 have been implicated as PTx receptors; however direct binding has only been demonstrated for glycoprotein Ib ( ). It is known that PTx can bind the serum glycoproteins fetuin and haptoglobin, which are used in toxin purification strategies ( ).Comparison of branch differences within the Sialo N group can give insight into the recognition process.

515,"increasing interest in rodent models for movement disorders has led to an increasing need for more accurate and precise methods for both delineating the nature of abnormal movements and measuring their severity. these studies describe application of simultaneous high speed video kinematics with multi channel emg to characterize the movement disorder exhibited by tottering mutant mice. these mice provide a uniquely valuable model because they exhibit paroxysmal dystonia superimposed on mild baseline ataxia, permitting the examination of these two different problems within the same animals. at baseline with mild ataxia, the mutants exhibited poorly coordinated movements with increased variation of stance and swing times, and slower spontaneous walking velocities. the corresponding emg showed reduced mean amplitudes of biceps femoris (bf) and vastus lateralis (vl), and poorly modulated emg activities during the step cycle. attacks of paroxysmal dystonia were preceded by trains of emg bursts with doublets and triplets simultaneously in the bf and vl followed by more sustained co activation. these emg characteristics are consistent with the clinical phenomenology of the motor phenotype of tottering mice as a baseline of mild ataxia with intermittent attacks of paroxysmal dystonia. the emg characteristics of ataxia and dystonia in the tottering mice also are consistent with emg studies of other ataxic or dystonic animals and humans. these studies provide insights into how these methods can be used for delineating movement disorders in mice, and for how they may be compared with similar disorders of humans.","This method permits precise delineation of complex movements by breaking them down into their component parts. Modern advances in the neurosciences have driven increasing interest in rodent models of human neurological diseases. These mice carry a calcium channel mutation resulting in a characteristic syndrome that has been evaluated extensively, including a video demonstration., The step patterns were grouped into stance and swing phases, and time normalized to 100 points with 50 points each in stance and swing phases. Synchronized recordings of multi channel EMG with video kinematics were made 214 days following surgical implantation of EMG electrode arrays, as mice walked on a motorized treadmill, as previously described.These observations highlight one of the limitations of classical kinematic analyses. The clinical features of ataxia in humans are well known to most clinicians.

517,"aims electrocardiographic ventricular repolarization qt parameters are independent risk factors for cardiovascular events and sudden cardiac death in diabetic patients. the aim of the study was to investigate the association of polymorphisms of the nitric oxide synthase adaptor protein (nos1ap) gene with qt interval in chinese subjects with or without type diabetes. methods three single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) (rs10494366, rs12143842 and rs12029454) were genotyped in type diabetic patients (631 men and women) and normal controls (433 men and women). individuals with overt diseases other than diabetes were excluded. heart rate corrected qt interval (qtc) was determined by standard 12 lead ecg and bazett formula. sex pooled analysis and sex specific analysis for genotypephenotype association were both conducted. results in the diabetic group, the rs12143842 t allele was associated with a 3.87 ms (p = 0.014, empirical p = 0.039) increase in qtc duration for each additional allele copy, while rs10494366 and rs12029454 exhibited no significant association with qtc. we found no evidence of association for the three snps in subjects with normal glucose regulation. no significant snp gender and diabetes affection interaction was observed. conclusions the genetic variant rs12143842 in nos1ap is associated with qt interval duration in a chinese population with type diabetes. future studies in different populations are needed to validate this finding and to evaluate the impact of nos1ap variants on cardiovascular events and sudden cardiac death in diabetic patients.","An abnormally prolonged QT interval duration is the feature of long QT syndrome, which is characterized by life threatening arrythmias and sudden cardiac death .

518,"the ability of brief exposure to alcohol to cause widespread neuroapoptosis in the developing rodent brain and subsequent long term neurocognitive deficits has been proposed as a mechanism underlying the neurobehavioral deficits seen in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (fasd). it is unknown whether brief exposure to alcohol causes apoptosis in the fetal primate brain. pregnant fasicularis macaques at various stages of gestation (g105 to g155) were exposed to alcohol for hours, then the fetuses were delivered by caesarian section and their brains perfused with fixative and evaluated for apoptosis. compared to saline control brains, the ethanol exposed brains displayed a pattern of neuroapoptosis that was widespread and similar to that caused by alcohol in infant rodent brain. the observed increase in apoptosis was on the order of 60 fold. we propose that the apoptogenic action of alcohol could explain many of the neuropathological changes and long term neuropsychiatric disturbances associated with human fasd.","In vivo rodent models have utilized chronic exposure models.

519,"whereas some research suggests that acknowledgment of the role of biogenetic factors in mental illness could reduce mental illness stigma by diminishing perceived responsibility, other research has cautioned that emphasizing biogenetic aspects of mental illness could produce the impression that mental illness is a stable, intrinsic aspect of a person (genetic essentialism), increasing the desire for social distance. we assessed genetic and neurobiological causal attributions about mental illness among people with serious mental illness and members of the public. the perceived responsibility of persons with mental illness for their condition, as well as fear and social distance, were assessed by self report. automatic associations between mental illness and guilt and between self and guilt were measured by the brief implicit association test. among the general public, endorsement of biogenetic models was associated with less perceived responsibility, but also greater social distance. among people with mental illness, endorsement of genetic models had only negative correlates: greater explicit fear and stronger implicit self guilt associations. genetic models may have unexpected negative consequences for implicit self concept and explicit attitudes of people with serious mental illness. an exclusive focus on genetic models may therefore be problematic for clinical practice and anti stigma initiatives.","Extensive research on the etiology of psychiatric disorders has vastly expanded our understanding of the role played by genetic and neurobiological factors in mental illnesses .

520,"memantine is a partial nmda receptor antagonist that has been shown to improve learning and memory in several animal models, and is approved for the treatment of alzheimers disease. chronic treatments using memantine in animal models of alzheimers disease show disease modifying effects and suggest a potential neuroprotective function. the present study assessed the effects of both short and long term memantine treatment in a mouse model of down syndrome, the ts65dn mouse. the ts65dn mouse contains a partial trisomy of murine chromosome 16, and exhibits hippocampal dependent memory deficits, as well as progressive degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons. ts65dn mice were treated with memantine for a period of six months, beginning at four months of age. at the end of treatment the mice underwent memory testing using novel object recognition and water radial arm maze tasks, and then histologically analyzed for markers of neurodegeneration. memantine treatment improved spatial and recognition memory performance in the ts65dn mice, though not to the level of normosomic littermate controls. despite these memory improvements, histological analysis found no morphological signs of neuroprotection of basal forebrain cholinergic or locus coeruleus neurons in memantine treated ts65dn mice. however, memantine treatment of ts65dn mice gave rise to elevated brain derived neurotrophic factor expression in the hippocampus and frontal cortex, suggesting a mechanism of behavioral modification. thus, our findings provide further evidence for memory facilitation of memantine, but suggest pharmacological rather than neuroprotective effects of memantine both after acute and chronic treatment in this mouse model.","Conventional therapies for AD for many years have focused on cholinesterase inhibitors, which function by blocking acetyl cholinesterase enzymatic activity resulting in increased levels of acetylcholine at the synapse, and have been used as the conventional therapy for AD for many years [for review: ].

524,"gambling is a common recreational activity that becomes dysfunctional in a subset of individuals, with dsm pathological gambling regarded as the most severe form. during gambling, players experience a range of cognitive distortions that promote an over estimation of the chances of winning. near miss outcomes are thought to fuel these distortions. we observed previously that near misses recruited overlapping circuitry to monetary wins in a study in healthy volunteers (clark et al. 2009). the present study sought to extend these observations in regular gamblers and relate brain responses to an index of gambling severity. twenty regular gamblers, who varied in their involvement from recreational players to probable pathological gamblers, were scanned whilst performing a simplified slot machine task that delivered occasional monetary wins, as well as near miss and full miss non win outcomes. in the overall group, near miss outcomes were associated with a significant response in the ventral striatum, which was also recruited by monetary wins. gambling severity, measured with the south oaks gambling screen, predicted a greater response in the dopaminergic midbrain to near miss outcomes. this effect survived controlling for clinical co morbidities that were present in the regular gamblers. gambling severity did not predict win related responses in the midbrain or elsewhere. these results demonstrate that near miss events during gambling recruit reward related brain circuitry in regular players. an association with gambling severity in the midbrain suggests that near miss outcomes may enhance dopamine transmission in disordered gambling, which extends neurobiological similarities between pathological gambling and drug addiction.","Near misses are able to promote continued gambling despite their objective non win (loss) status (, ).

530,"a new methodology using hydrogen/deuterium amide exchange (hdx) to determine the binding affinity of protein peptide interactions is reported. the method, based on our previously established approach, plimstex (protein ligand interaction by mass spectrometry, titration and h/d exchange) [j. am. chem. soc. 2003, 125, 52525253], makes use of a dilution strategy (dplimstex) for hdx, using the mass of the peptide ligand as readout. we employed dplimstex to study the interaction of calcium saturated calmodulin with the opioid peptide endorphin as a model system; the affinity results are in good agreement with those from traditional plimstex and with literature values obtained by using other methods. we show that the dplimstex method is feasible to quantify an antigen antibody interaction involving a 3 nitrotyrosine modified peptide in complex with a monoclonal anti nitrotyrosine antibody. a dissociation constant in the low nanomolar range, was determined, and a binding stoichiometry of antibody/peptide of 1:2 was confirmed. in addition, we determined that the epitope in the binding interface contains a minimum of five amino acids. the dplimstex approach is a sensitive and powerful tool for the quantitative determination of peptide affinities with antibodies, complementary to conventional immuno analytical techniques.","Nevertheless, HDX is effective for epitope mapping to probe antibody antigen interactions [, ]. Thus far, there are no reports of extending these MS based methods to antibody antigen binding .

532,"a number of studies have examined the perception of time with durations ranging from milliseconds to a few seconds, however the neural basis of these processes are still poorly understood and the neural substrates underlying the perception of multiple second intervals are unknown. here we present evidence of neural systems activity in circumscribed areas of the human brain involved in the encoding of intervals with durations of and seconds in a temporal reproduction task using event related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri). during the encoding there was greater activation in more posterior parts of the medial frontal and insular cortex whereas the reproduction phase involved more anterior parts of these brain structures. intriguingly, activation curves over time show an accumulating pattern of neural activity, which peaks at the end of the interval within bilateral posterior insula and superior temporal cortex when individuals are presented with 9 and 18 second tone intervals. this is consistent with an accumulator type activity, which encodes duration in the multiple seconds range. given the close connection between the dorsal posterior insula and ascending internal body signals, we suggest that the accumulation of physiological changes in body states constitutes our experience of time. this is the first time that an accumulation function in the posterior insula is detected that might be correlated with the encoding of time intervals.","In addition, this list is expansive as it includes studies on numerous time intervals, which recruit different brain areas.

535,"in humans, most hearing loss results from death of hair cells, the mechanosensory receptors of the inner ear. two goals of current hearing research are to protect hair cells from degeneration and to regenerate new hair cells, replacing those that are lost due to aging, disease, or environmental challenges. one limitation of research in the auditory field has been the relative inaccessibility of the mechanosensory systems in the inner ear. zebrafish possess hair cells that are morphologically and functionally similar to human hair cells in both their inner ear and their lateral line system. the external location of the mechanosensory hair cells in the lateral line and the ease of in vivo labeling and imaging make the zebrafish lateral line a unique system for the study of hair cell toxicity, protection, and regeneration. this review focuses on the lateral line system as a model for understanding loss and protection of mechanosensory hair cells. we discuss chemical screens to identify compounds that induce hair cell loss and others that protect hair cells from known toxins and the potential application of these screens to human medicine.","Nearly 15% (29 million) of U.S. adults aged 20 69 report hearing impairment.

537,"a ubiquitous yet underappreciated protein post translational modification, isoaspartic acid (isoasp, isod or asp), generated via the deamidation of asparagine or isomerization of aspartic acid in proteins, plays a diverse and crucial role in ageing, as well as autoimmune, cancer, neurodegeneration and other diseases. in addition, formation of isoasp is a major concern in protein pharmaceuticals, as it may lead to aggregation or activity loss. the scope and significance of isoasp have, up to now, not been fully explored, as an unbiased screening of isoasp at low abundance remains challenging. this difficulty is due to the subtle difference in the physicochemical properties between isoasp and asp, e.g., identical mass. in contrast, endoprotease asp n (ec 3.4.24.33) selectively cleaves aspartyl peptides but not the isoaspartyl counterparts. as a consequence, isoaspartyl peptides can be differentiated from those containing asp and also enriched by asp n digestion. subsequently, the existence and site of isoaspartate can be confirmed by electron transfer dissociation (etd) mass spectrometry. as little as 0.5 % of isoasp was detected in synthetic beta amyloid and cytochrome c peptides, even though both were initially assumed to be free of isoasp. taken together, our approach should expedite the unbiased discovery of isoasp.","The problem is even more exacerbated when Asp and isoAsp peptides co elute. Formation of isoAsp inserts an extra methylene group into the protein backbone, resulting in a beta peptide linkage. Furthermore, even present at low abundance, isoAsp may also trigger autoimmune responses, likely due to altered antigen presentation.as little as 0.5 % of isoasp was detected in synthetic beta amyloid and cytochrome c peptides, even though both were initially assumed to be free of isoasp. the scope and significance of isoasp have, up to now, not been fully explored, as an unbiased screening of isoasp at low abundance remains challenging.

541,"sodium pyruvate (sp) treatment initiated within min post injury is neuroprotective in a rat model of unilateral cortical contusion injury (cci). the current studies examined: (1) effects of delayed sp treatments (1000 mg/kg, i.p., at 1, and h), (2) effects of single (1 h) or multiple (1, and h) ethyl pyruvate treatments (ep; at or mg/kg, i.p.), and (3) mechanisms of action for pyruvate effects after cci. in experiment 1, both sp and ep treatment(s) significantly reduced the number of dead/dying cells in the ipsilateral hippocampus (dentate hilus+ca3c and/or ca3a b regions) at h post cci. pyruvate treatment(s) attenuated cci induced reductions of cerebral cytochrome oxidase activity at h, significantly improving activity in peri contusional cortex after multiple sp or ep treatments. optical density measures of ipsilateral cd11b immuno staining were significantly increased h post cci, but these measures of microglia activation were not different from sham injury values in sp and ep groups with three post cci treatments. in experiment 2, three treatments (1, and h) of sp (1000 mg/kg) or ep (40 mg/kg) significantly improved recovery of beam walking and neurological scores in the first three weeks after cci, and ep treatments significantly improved spatial working memory one week post cci. ipsilateral ca3b neuronal loss, but not cortical tissue loss, was significantly reduced one month post cci with pyruvate treatments begun h post cci. thus, delayed pyruvate treatments after cci are neuroprotective and improve neurobehavioral recovery; these effects may be mediated by improved metabolism and reduced inflammation.","After transient forebrain ischemia induced by bilateral carotid artery occlusion and hypotension, SP almost completely blocked zinc toxicity and prevented cell death in both hippocampus and parietal cortex .

546,"artificial percepts (phosphenes) can be induced by applying transcranial magnetic stimulation (tms) over human visual cortex. although phosphenes have been used to study visual awareness, the neural mechanisms generating them have not yet been delineated. we directly tested the two leading hypotheses of how phosphenes arise. these hypotheses correspond to the two competing views of the neural genesis of awareness: the early, feedforward view and the late, recurrent feedback model. we combined online tms and eeg recordings to investigate whether the electrophysiological correlates of conscious phosphene perception are detectable early after tms onset as an immediate local effect of tms, or only at longer latencies, after interactions of tms induced activity with other visual areas. stimulation was applied at the intensity threshold at which participants saw a phosphene on half of the trials, and brain activity was recorded simultaneously with electroencephalography. phosphene perception was associated with a differential pattern of tms evoked brain potentials that started to ms after stimulation, and encompassed a wide array of posterior areas. this pattern was differentiated from the tms evoked potential after stimulation of a control site. these findings suggest that conscious phosphene perception is not a local phenomenon, but arises only after extensive recurrent processing.","TMS induced phosphenes can be used to explore the neural dynamics underlying visual perception (; ; ; ; ).

554,"strategies to control the release rate of bioactive signals from tissue engineering scaffolds are essential for tissue regeneration and tissue engineering applications. here we report on a strategy to achieve temporal control over nanoparticle release from biomaterials using cell secreted proteases. this cell triggered release approach utilizes peptides that are degraded by matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) at different rates to immobilize nanoparticles directly to the biomaterial surface. thus, the peptide immobilized nanoparticles are released with temporal control through the action of cell released mmps. we found that release rates of peptide immobilized nanoparticles were a function of peptide sensitivity to proteases, the number of tethers between the nanoparticle and the surface and the concentration of proteases used to induce release. cellular internalization of the peptide immobilized nanoparticles was also a function of the peptide sensitivity to proteases, the number of tethers between the nanoparticle and the surface and mmp expression profile of the cells. similar trends were observed for peptide immobilized nanoparticles inside micro porous hydrogels, indicating protease sensitive tethers are effective in controlling release rate and internalization of nanoparticles. such a temporal delivery strategy of nanoparticles loaded with therapeutic payloads (e.g. protein, dna, sirna) can be an ideal means to guide tissue formation.","Bioresponsive scaffolds that provide mechanical, biological, and chemical cues to the diseased tissue have the potential to aid in its regeneration in ways that are not currently possible .

555,"this paper examines the effect of a students own school adjustment as well as the contextual level of school adjustment (the normative level of school adjustment among students in a school) on student's self reported use of alcohol. using a dataset of 43,465 male and female 8th grade students from schools across the contiguous united states who participated in a national study of substance use in rural communities between and 2000, multilevel latent covariate models were utilized to disentangle the individual level and contextual effects of three school adjustment variables (i.e., school bonding, behavior at school, and friends school bonding) on alcohol use. all three school adjustment factors were significant predictors of alcohol use both within and between schools. furthermore, this study demonstrated a strong contextual effect; students who attended schools where the overall level of school adjustment was higher reported lower levels of alcohol use even after taking their own school adjustment into account. the results demonstrate the importance of both a students own level of school adjustment and the normative level of school adjustment among students in the school on an adolescents use of alcohol. differences in school adjustment across schools were quite strongly related to an adolescent's own alcohol use, indicating that school adjustment is an important aspect of school climate. initiatives aimed at improving school climate may have beneficial effects on students alcohol use.","In this paper, we address this understudied topic.

559,"stomata are microscopic pores formed by pairs of guard cells in the epidermis of terrestrial plants; they are essential for gas exchange with the environment and controlling water loss. accordingly, plants regulate stomatal aperture in response to environmental conditions, such as relative humidity, co2 concentration, and light intensity. stomatal openings are also a major route of pathogen entry into the plant and plants have evolved mechanisms to regulate stomatal aperture as an immune response against bacterial invasion. in this review, we highlight studies that begin to elucidate signaling events involved in bacterium triggered stomatal closure and discuss how pathogens may have exploited environmental conditions or, in some cases, have evolved virulence factors to actively counter stomatal closure to facilitate invasion.","The phyllosphere (i.e., aerial parts of terrestrial plants) provides one of the most important niches for microbial inhabitation . However, until recently stomata have generally been considered to be passive portals of entry for plant pathogenic bacteria. To initiate pathogenesis, plant pathogenic bacteria must first enter plant tissues.In particular, enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica appear to be some of the most common causal agents of food poisoning associated with the consumption of fresh leafy vegetables .

However, when tested in the dark, under which condition stomata are closed, bacteria were detected only on the leaf surface .Invasion of plants by microbial pathogens is a critical step in causing plant disease and human pathogen contamination, yet our knowledge in this area remains incomplete. As discussed in this review, stomata represent a major route of pathogen invasion and recent studies have begun to shed light on the signal transduction cascades underlying bacterial regulation of stomatal closure and opening. Current results suggest that stomatal closure is a functional output of both PAMP triggered and effector triggered immunity.","The phyllosphere (i.e., aerial parts of terrestrial plants) provides one of the most important niches for microbial inhabitation .

563,"summary mouse models have been designed for a number of fatty acid oxidation defects. studies in these mouse models have demonstrated that different pathogenetic mechanisms play a role in the pathophysiology of defects of fatty acid oxidation. supplementation with l carnitine does not prevent low tissue carnitine levels and induces acylcarnitine production having potentially toxic effects, as presented in very long chain acyl coa dehydrogenase (vlcad) deficient mice. energy deficiency appears to be an important mechanism in the development of cardiomyopathy and skeletal myopathy in fatty acid oxidation defects and is also the underlying mechanism of cold intolerance. hypoglycemia as one major clinical sign in all fatty acid oxidation defects occurs due to a reduced hepatic glucose output and an enhanced peripheral glucose uptake rather than to transcriptional changes that are also observed simultaneously as presented in medium chain acyl coa dehydrogenase (mcad) deficient mice. there are reports that impaired fatty acid oxidation also plays a role in intrauterine life. the embryonic loss demonstrated for some enzyme defects in the mouse supports this hypothesis, however the exact mechanisms are unknown. this observation correlates to maternal hellp syndrome as observed in pregnancies carrying a long chain 3 hydroxyacyl co a dehydrogenase (lchad) deficient fetus. synergistic heterozygosity has been shown in isolated patients and in mouse models to be associated with clinical phenotypes common to fatty acid oxidation disorders. synergistic mutations may also modulate severity of the clinical phenotype and explain in part clinical heterogeneity of fatty acid oxidation defects. in summary, knowledge about the different pathogenetic mechanisms and the resulting pathophysiology allows the development of specific new therapies.","Whereas some patients present with the full spectrum of disease and a multisystemic disease, others only exhibit hypoglycemia during illness or episodes of rhabdomyolysis due to vigorous exercise.

565,"autism is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a triad of complications. autistic individuals display significant disturbances in language and reciprocal social interactions, combined with repetitive and stereotypic behaviors. prevalence studies suggest that autism is more common than originally believed, with recent estimates citing a rate of one in 150. although this genomic approach has yielded multiple suggestive regions, a specific risk locus has yet to be identified and widely confirmed. because many etiologies have been suggested for this complex syndrome, we hypothesize that one of the difficulties in identifying autism genes is that multiple genetic variants may be required to significantly increase the risk of developing autism. thus we took the alternative approach of examining prominent dopamine pathway candidate genes for detailed study by genotyping snps. although we did observe a nominally significant association for rs2239535 (p=.008) on chromosome 20, single locus analysis did not reveal any results as significant after correction for multiple comparisons. no significant interaction was identified when multifactor dimensionality reduction (mdr) was employed to test specifically for multilocus effects. although genome wide linkage scans in autism have provided support for linkage to various loci along the dopamine pathway, our study does not provide strong evidence of linkage or association to any specific gene or combination of genes within the pathway. these results demonstrate that common genetic variation within the tested genes located within this pathway at most play a minor to moderate role in overall autism pathogenesis.","Other drugs such as Haldol, a dopamine antagonist, and Welbutrin, a dopamine uptake inhibitor, have proven effective in some autistic children.

566,"the development of a low cost, simple colorimetric sensor array capable of detection and identification of toxic gases is reported. this technology uses a disposable printed array of porous pigments in which metalloporphyrins and chemically responsive dyes are immobilized in a porous matrix of organically modified siloxanes (ormosils) and printed on a porous membrane. the printing of the ormosil into the membrane is highly uniform and does not lessen the porosity of the membrane, as shown by scanning electron microscopy. when exposed to an analyte, these pigments undergo reactions that result in well defined color changes due to strong chemical interactions: ligation to metal ions, lewis or bronsted acid base interactions, hydrogen bonding, etc. striking visual identification of toxic gases has been shown at the idlh (immediately dangerous to life and health), at the pel (permissible exposure level), and at a level well below the pel. identification and quantification of analytes were achieved using the color change profiles, which were readily distinguishable in a hierarchical clustering analysis (hca) dendrogram, with no misclassifications in trials.","Furthermore, the final properties of the porous pigments (e.g., hydrophobicity, porosity, and surface area) can be easily modified by controlling the physical and chemical parameters of the sol gel process.

Classification analysis reveals that the colorimetric sensor array has an extremely high dimensionality (10 dimensions for 90% of total variance), which holds promise of the ability to discriminate among very large numbers of toxic gases at low concentrations . As a confirmation of this enthalpy analysis, we have tested our porous pigments array against three different toxic gases: ammonia, sulfur dioxide and chlorine.","Furthermore, the final properties of the porous pigments (e.g., hydrophobicity, porosity, and surface area) can be easily modified by controlling the physical and chemical parameters of the sol gel process. Sensing technology for toxic gases is important for both security and environmental monitoring. While monoliths, films, and fibers of individual porous pigments are known,, we report here a new method of printing arrays of chemically responsive porous pigments directly onto inert fluoropolymer (polyvinylidene diflouride, PVDF) membranes.Formulations of phenethyltrimethoxysilane with metalloporphyrins or mixtures of methyltriethoxysilane, triethoxy(octyl)silane with pH or solvatochromic indicators were used .

567,"background neonatal gene therapy is a promising strategy for treating diseases diagnosed before or shortly after birth. early and long term expression of therapeutic proteins may limit the consequences of genetic mutations and result in a potential cure. adeno associated viral vectors have shown promise in many areas of adult gene therapy but their properties have not been systematically investigated in the neonate. methods in these studies using a constitutive promoter expressing luciferase, animals were administered one of ten serotypes of aav on the second day of life. examination of expression, organ growth and vector distribution, maintenance of expression and copy number were examined. results all serotypes demonstrated expression and, in general, transduction of all organs within days, albeit with different biodistribution patterns and expression levels. highest expression was detected with aavrh10 while lowest was with aav4. expression and genomes declined with growth over the first weeks of life; thereafter, to day 100, expression and genomes remained relatively stable. with the highest expressing vectors, whole animal expression at days declined to ~10% of that detected on the fifth day. aavrh10 maintained the highest expression level and copy number throughout these studies. conclusion the impact of tissue and organ growth on the stability of aav expression will be important if neonatal gene transfer is to be considered as a modality for human gene therapy. while all vectors did demonstrate expression, rh10 holds the greater promise of the vectors tested to maintain copy number in both mitotic and post mitotic tissues.","Some vectors, particularly rh10, may be better suited in such applications . Few studies have examined the efficacy of therapy directed at the neonate and its organs. Recombinant adeno associated viral (AAV) vectors are capable of achieving persistent gene transfer in a number of tissues in adult animals and have shown significant promise as a method for gene therapy in multiple inherited genetic or acquired abnormalities.All samples were measured for 10 seconds after a five second delay. All handling of animals was performed in accordance with the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Chancellors Committee for Animal Research guidelines. Six of 226 (2.7%) mice died before they were studied.Statistical evaluation was performed using the two tailed t test. A larger loss of vector before uncoating might explain this. In the adult mouse, hepatocytes are replaced slowly: once every 180 400 days.","Some vectors, particularly rh10, may be better suited in such applications .

568,"summary this paper describes a slipchip to perform digital pcr in a very simple and inexpensive format. the fluidic path for introducing the sample combined with the pcr mixture was formed using elongated wells in the two plates of the slipchip designed to overlap during sample loading. this fluidic path was broken up by simple slipping of the two plates that removed the overlap among wells and brought each well in contact with a reservoir preloaded with oil to generate 1,280 reaction compartments (2.6 nl each) simultaneously. after thermal cycling, end point fluorescence intensity was used to detect the presence of nucleic acid. digital pcr on the slipchip was tested quantitatively by using staphylococcus aureus genomic dna. as the concentration of the template dna in the reaction mixture was diluted, the fraction of positive wells decreased as expected from the statistical analysis. no cross contamination was observed during the experiments. at the extremes of the dynamic range of digital pcr the standard confidence interval determined using a normal approximation of the binomial distribution is not satisfactory. therefore, statistical analysis based on the score method was used to establish these confidence intervals. the slipchip provides a simple strategy to count nucleic acids by using pcr. it may find applications in research applications such as single cell analysis, prenatal diagnostics, and point of care diagnostics. slipchip would become valuable for diagnostics, including applications in resource limited areas after integration with isothermal nucleic acid amplification technologies and visual readout.","Therefore, it can achieve compartmentalization without requiring a complex fabrication process or a complex manipulation system. As the plates are slipped past one another, the wells and ducts are brought in and out of contact to combine reagents and perform reactions. Droplet based approaches are attractive for a wide range of applications,, but they require pumping equipment and equipment for rapid readout.All solvents and salts purchased from commercial sources were used as received unless otherwise stated. SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix (2) was purchased from Bio Rad Laboratories (Hercules, CA). Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was purchased from Roche Diagnostics (Indianapolis, IN).Etching speed was controlled by controlling the temperature, and 35 min etching time at 40 C produced wells that were 50 m deep . The digital PCR SlipChip would also find additional applications if multiple samples could be screened on the same chip as in SlipChips designed for protein crystallization experiments,, immunoassays, and multiplex PCR. The mineral oil was filtered and degassed before using.","Therefore, it can achieve compartmentalization without requiring a complex fabrication process or a complex manipulation system.

569,"background the effects of dyssynchrony on global left ventricular (lv) mechanics have been well documented; however, its impact on lv energetics has received less attention. objective to assess the effects of lv contraction dyssynchrony on global lv mechano energetic function in a pacing induced acute model of dyssynchrony. methods using blood perfused isolated rabbit heart preparations (n = 11), lv pressure, coronary flow, and arteriovenous oxygen content difference were recorded for isovolumic contractions under right atrial (ra) pacing (control) and simultaneous ra and right ventricular outflow tract (rvot) pacing (dyssynchrony). lv mechanical function was quantified by the end systolic pressure volume relationship (espvr). myocardial oxygen consumption pressure volume area (mvo2 pva) relationship quantified lv energetic function. internal pva for mvo2rvot was calculated based on the mvo2 pva relationship for ra pacing. thus, lost pva (internal pva pvarvot) represents the mechanical energy not observable at the global level. results compared to ra pacing, rvot pacing depressed lv mechanics as indicated by a rightward shift of espvr (i.e., increase in vd from 0.58 0.10 to 0.67 0.10 ml, p < 0.05). despite depressed mechanics, rvot pacing was associated with greater mvo2 such that the mvo2 pva relationship intercept was markedly increased from 0.025 0.003 to 0.029 0.003 mlo2/beat/100glv (p < 0.05). excess mvo2 (i.e., mvo2rvot mvo2ra) significantly correlated with lost pva (r2 = 0.54, p < 0.001). conclusion a potential mechanism explaining the observed increase in mvo2 with dyssynchrony may be that the measured pva at the global level underestimates the internal pva at the cellular level, which is likely to be the true determinant of mvo2.","The effects of contraction dyssynchrony on global LV mechanical function have been well documented; however, its impact on LV energetic function has received less attention. Instead of producing an efficient output, this dyssynchronous wall motion causes substantial volume shifts within the LV cavity, resulting in a decrease in stroke volume and ultimately an increase in end diastolic volume. The blood perfused isolated heart preparation offers a rigorously controlled environment to evaluate intrinsic LV mechano energetic function.This is not a completely theoretical conjecture; there is experimental evidence for it. The luxury of having this extra piece of information allowed us to calculate PVA (i.e., PVA that was consistent with measured MVO2 under RVOT pacing). Statistical analyses were performed using SAS statistical software package (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).Following RVOT pacing induced contraction dyssynchrony, global LV mechano energetic function was adversely affected. In the current study, we used RVOT pacing to induce LV contraction dyssynchrony. Pacing at the RVOT is known to prematurely excite the septum and consequently produce delayed LV free wall contraction causing a LBBB like contraction pattern.","The effects of contraction dyssynchrony on global LV mechanical function have been well documented; however, its impact on LV energetic function has received less attention.

570,"background & aims prolonged episodes of acute diarrhea (prod, duration days) or persistent diarrhea (pd, duration days) are important causes of undernutrition, yet the epidemiology and nutritional impact of prod are poorly understood. methods we conducted a 10 year cohort study of children from a brazilian shantytown who were followed from birth; data were collected on diarrhea, enteric pathogens, and anthropometry. results during 1,276 child years of observation, we recorded 3,257 diarrheal episodes. prod was twice as common as pd (12% and 5% of episodes, respectively); prod and pd together accounted for 50% of all days with diarrhea. prod was more common in infants whose mothers had not completed primary school (relative risk [rr]=2.1; 95% confidence interval=1.022.78). early weaning was associated with earlier onset of prod (spearman's , 0.309; p=0.005). infants with prod were twice as likely to develop pd in later childhood (log rank p=0.002) compared to infants with only acute diarrhea (ad, duration <7 days), even after controlling for confounders. children's growth was more severely stunted before their first episode of prod, compared with ad (mean height for age z score (haz) 0.81 vs. 0.51, p<0.05, unpaired t test). following prod, haz (haz= 0.232) and weight for age (waz= 0.26) significantly decreased (p<0.005 in paired t tests). prod was associated with cryptosporidium and shigella infections. conclusions prod accounts for significant morbidity and identifies children at risk of a vicious cycle of diarrhea and malnutrition. further studies are needed to address the recognition and control of prod and its consequences in resource limited settings and assess its role in pd pathogenesis.","Furthermore, heavy burdens of diarrhea and undernutrition in early childhood profoundly impair growth and development.

However, it is extremely difficult to distinguish ongoing trends in abortion rates from the influence of changes in the law that may have occurred 810 years earlier.

576,"this manuscript reports the results of a study that pilot tested a home delivered, multi dimensional problem solving intervention aimed at helping aging parental caregivers of adult children with schizophrenia. the results indicate that the participants (n=5) who received the 10 session intervention showed increased life satisfaction and emotional well being, and reduced feelings of burden, compared to those participants in the control group (n=10). if a planned larger scale evaluation of the intervention provides evidence of its effectiveness, practitioners could have a valuable new treatment tool to provide assistance to this caregiver population.","Despite an increasing number of intervention studies that have targeted families of adults with SMI, there has been little research that has focused exclusively on developing interventions to address the unique needs of aging parental caregivers of this population . These issues are often further complicated by shortages of formal services and residential options for persons with SMI (; ; ). The complex and debilitating problems experienced by these adult children, and their continued dependency, may have serious negative consequences for their aging parents.A wait list control (delayed treatment) experimental design was used to examine the impact of the brief problem solving intervention on the life satisfaction and emotional well being of the aging parental caregivers in the study. Assessment 2 was administered to these participants one month following their final treatment session. Participants in the immediate treatment group began their 10 session intervention program as soon as possible after Assessment 1.The intervention described in this paper shows promise in improving the emotional well being and life satisfaction of aging parent caregivers of adult children with SMI, and in reducing the feelings of burden often reported by such parents. If researchers are successful in developing such evidence based interventions, social work practitioners will be able to help enrich the lives of these family caregivers as well as the lives of the sons and daughters for whom they care. As the service and therapeutic needs of this population continue into the future, the importance of family members as the providers of assistance to persons with SMI will increase due, in part, to the increasing budgetary pressures most human service agencies are likely to experience .","Despite an increasing number of intervention studies that have targeted families of adults with SMI, there has been little research that has focused exclusively on developing interventions to address the unique needs of aging parental caregivers of this population .

581,"depressive symptoms in alcohol dependent individuals are well recognized and clinically relevant phenomena. the etiology has not been elucidated although it is clear that the depressive symptoms may be alcohol independent or alcohol induced. in order to contribute to the understanding of the neurobiology of chronic ethanol use, we investigated the effects of chronic intermittent ethanol vapor exposure on behaviors in the forced swim test (fst) and neuropeptide y (npy) and corticotropin releasing factor (crf) levels in specific brain regions. adult male wistar rats were subjected to intermittent ethanol vapor (14 hours on / hours off) or air exposure for two weeks and were then tested at three time points corresponding to acute withdrawal (812 hours into withdrawal) and protracted withdrawal (30 and days of withdrawal) in the fst. the behaviors that were measured in the five minute fst consisted of latency to immobility, swim time, immobility time and climbing time. the fst results showed that the vapor exposed animals displayed depressive like behaviors, for instance decreased latency to immobility in acute withdrawal and decreased latency to immobility, decreased swim time and increased immobility time in protracted withdrawal, with differences between air and vapor exposed animals becoming more pronounced over the day withdrawal period. npy levels in the frontal cortex of the vapor exposed animals were decreased compared to the control animals and crf levels in the amygdala were correlated with increased immobility time. thus, extended ethanol vapor exposure produced long lasting changes in fst behavior and npy levels in the brain.","Furthermore, it has been shown that of those diagnosed with comorbid clinical depression and alcohol dependence, a substantial percentage had symptomology that was determined to be alcohol induced .

583,"chronic gastritis induced by helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) is the strongest known risk factor for adenocarcinoma of the distal stomach, yet the effects of bacterial eradication on carcinogenesis remain unclear. h. pylori isolates possess substantial genotypic diversity, which engenders differential host inflammatory responses that influence clinical outcome. h. pylori strains that possess the cag pathogenicity island and secrete a functional cytotoxin induce more severe gastric injury and further augment the risk for developing distal gastric cancer. carcinogenesis is also influenced by host genetic diversity, particularly involving immune response genes such as interleukin 1 and tumor necrosis factor . human trials and animal studies have indicated that eradication of h. pylori prior to the development of atrophic gastritis offers the best chance for prevention of gastric cancer. however, although the timing of intervention influences the magnitude of suppression of premalignant and neoplastic lesions, bacterial eradication, even in longstanding infections, is of clear benefit to the host. it is important to gain insight into the pathogenesis of h. pylori induced gastritis and adenocarcinoma not only to develop more effective treatments for gastric cancer, but also because it might serve as a paradigm for the role of chronic inflammation in the genesis of other malignancies that arise within the gastrointestinal tract.","Intestinal type gastric adenocarcinoma was first identified nearly a century ago and progresses through a well defined series of histologic steps initiated by the transition from normal mucosa to chronic superficial gastritis, which then leads to atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia, and finally to dysplasia and adenocarcinoma [; ; ; ].

585,"attentional bias for drug related stimuli, as measured by emotional stroop (es) tasks, is predictive of treatment outcomes for tobacco smoking and other abused drugs. characterizing relationships between smoking related attentional bias and brain reactivity to smoking images may help identify neural substrates critical to relapse vulnerability. to this end, we investigated putative relations between interference effects in an offline smoking es task and functional mri (fmri) measures of brain reactivity to smoking versus neutral images in women smokers. positive correlations were found between attentional bias and reactivity to smoking images in brain areas involved in emotion, memory, interoception, and visual processing including the amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, insula, and occipital cortex. these findings suggest that smokers with elevated attentional biases to smoking related stimuli may more readily shift attention away from other external stimuli and toward smoking stimuli induced internal states and emotional memories. such attentional shifts may contribute to increased interference by smoking cues, possibly increasing relapse vulnerability. treatments capable of inhibiting shifts to drug cue induced memories and internal states may lead to personalized tobacco dependence treatment for smokers with high attentional bias to smoking related stimuli.","Such enhanced emotional reactivity to salient cues may act as a distracter.

587,"objective we sought to explore the effects of non selective cox and selective cox 2 inhibition on collateral development in a model of chronic myocardial ischemia. we hypothesized that cox 2 inhibitors will negatively effect angiogenic and inflammatory pathways. methods yorkshire swine were made chronically ischemic by placing an ameroid constrictor on the left circumflex coronary artery. swine were divided into three groups and given: no drug (control, n=7), a non selective cox inhibitor (naproxen 400mg daily, nap, n=7), or a selective cox 2 inhibitor (celecoxib 200mg daily, cbx, n=7). after weeks, coronary angiography was performed. myocardial function and microvascular reactivity were assessed. serum and myocardial tissue were analyzed for prostaglandin levels and markers of inflammation and angiogenesis. results the cbx group demonstrated significantly increased mean arterial pressure and decreased left ventricular function. myocardial perfusion in the cbx group was similar to the control, but less than in the nap group. coronary microvascular contraction in the collateral dependent territory was increased in the nap group, but minimally affected in the cbx group. oxidative stress and apoptosis were increased in the cbx group. expression of angiogenic markers, vegf and phospho enos (ser1177), and tissue levels of prostacyclin were decreased in both the cbx and nap groups. the nap group had diminished expression of endostatin. conclusion the effects of selective and non selective cox inhibition are more complex than previously published, but they do not decrease collateral dependent blood flow to the myocardium in our model of chronic myocardial ischemia.","With fewer (or less developed) protective collateral vessels, patients may suffer more devastating outcomes during ischemic cardiac events.

590,"whole bone morphology, cortical geometry, and tissue material properties modulate skeletal stresses and strains that in turn influence skeletal physiology and remodeling. understanding how bone stiffness, the relationship between applied load and tissue strain, is regulated by developmental changes in bone structure and tissue material properties is important in implementing biophysical strategies for promoting healthy bone growth and preventing bone loss. the goal of this study was to relate developmental patterns of in vivo whole bone stiffness to whole bone morphology, cross sectional geometry, and tissue properties using a mouse axial loading model. we measured in vivo tibial stiffness in three age groups (6wks, 10wks, 16wks old) of female c57bl/6 mice during cyclic tibial compression. tibial stiffness was then related to cortical geometry, longitudinal bone curvature, and tissue mineral density using microcomputed tomography (microct). tibial stiffness and the stresses induced by axial compression were generally maintained from to 16wks of age. growth related increases in cortical cross sectional geometry and longitudinal bone curvature had counteracting effects on induced bone stresses and, therefore, maintained tibial stiffness similarly with growth. tissue mineral density increased slightly from to 16wks of age, and although the effects of this increase on tibial stiffness were not directly measured, its role in the modulation of whole bone stiffness was likely minor over the age range examined. thus, whole bone morphology, as characterized by longitudinal curvature, along with cortical geometry, plays an important role in modulating bone stiffness during development and should be considered when evaluating and designing in vivo loading studies and biophysical skeletal therapies.","Similar results were reported for mouse tibiae loaded in cantilever bending at 10 weeks (wks) and 21mos of age .

591,"background though the presence of microsatellite instability (msi) in patients with colorectal cancer (crc) may have implications for prognosis, therapy, and family counseling, msi prevalence is not well described among individuals of hispanic origin in the united states (us) with crc. methods we conducted a retrospective cohort study employing a hospital based tumor registry to identify individuals of hispanic origin diagnosed with crc. clinical data and tumor samples were retrieved. molecular analyses included testing for msi using a panel of mononucleotide markers (bat25, bat26, nr21, nr24 and nr27) in a pentaplex polymerase chain reaction assay, as well as immunohistochemistry for the mmr proteins mlh1, msh2, msh6, and pmhs2 on representative tissue. results individuals of hispanic origin with crc were identified. 41.1% were women, median age was years (iqr:47.163.5). (9.8%, 95%ci:4.215.6) had msi crc, while (14.6%, 95%ci:7.321.8) had crc with1 mmr protein abnormality. of individuals with msi had clinical or molecular characteristics suspicious for lynch syndrome such as abnormal expression of msh2 and/or msh6 (n=7) or age<50 at diagnosis (n=7). conclusions the prevalence of msi crc among hispanic individuals may be similar to other races and ethnicities, but clinical pathological characteristics, including age at diagnosis and pattern of abnormal mmr protein expression, suggests that sporadic msi crc may be less common in individuals of hispanic origin, and that much msi observed in this situation may be attributable to lynch syndrome. further exploration of the causes of disparate presentations of crc by ethnicity and race is warranted.","The prevalence of MSI CRC has been described among Whites and African Americans in the United States (US) , , .

592,"purpose higher body mass index (bmi) has been implicated as a risk factor for developing pancreatic cancer, but its effect on survival has not been thoroughly investigated. we assessed the association of bmi with survival in a sample of pancreatic cancer patients and utilized epidemiologic and clinical information to understand the contribution of diabetes and hyperglycemia. methods a survival analysis using cox proportional hazards by usual adult bmi was performed on 1,861 unselected patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma; analyses were adjusted for covariates that included clinical stage, age, and sex. secondary analyses incorporated self reported diabetes and fasting blood glucose in the survival model. results bmi as a continuous variable was inversely associated with survival from pancreatic adenocarcinoma [hazard ratio 1.019 for each increased unit of bmi (kg/m2), p < 0.001] after adjustment for age, stage, and sex. in analysis by national institutes of health bmi category, bmi of 3034.99 kg/m2 (hr 1.14, 95% confidence interval 0.981.33), 3539.99 kg/m2 (hr 1.32, 95% ci 1.081.62), and (hr 1.60, 95% ci 1.262.04) were associated with decreased survival compared to normal bmi of 18,524.99 kg/m2 (overall trend test p<0.001). fasting blood glucose and diabetes did not affect the results. conclusions higher bmi is associated with decreased survival in pancreatic cancer. although the mechanism of this association remains undetermined, diabetes and hyperglycemia do not appear to account for the observed association.","High body mass index (BMI) has been consistently reported as a risk factor for pancreatic cancer. Though the mechanism for this increased risk is not yet established, hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance have been hypothesized. In one study using lean and obese mice inoculated with murine pancreatic cancer cells, higher serum insulin and lower adiponectin in obese mice correlated with increased tumor cell proliferation, but there was no change in apoptosis indices.Date of death or last known date alive was selected from the most current data among multiple sources as described in Methods. The study was reviewed and approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board, and written, informed consent was obtained on all subjects . Risk factor questionnaires provided self report of diabetes (Y/N), cigarette smoking was recorded as ever/never, and also by typical packs per day for smoking intensity.This is in distinction to a recent letter stating diabetes was associated with worsened survival in the Li et al paper.

593,"atmospheric pressure imaging mass spectrometry is a rapidly expanding field that offers advantages in the ability to study biological systems in their native condition, simplified sample preparation, and high throughput experiments. in laser ablation electrospray ionization (lae si), the native water molecules in biological tissues facilitate sampling by a focused mid infrared laser beam. the ionization of the ablated material is accomplished by electrospray postionization. in this work, we demonstrate that the imaging variant of laesi simultaneously provides lateral distributions for small metabolites and lipids directly in rat brain sections. to cope with the fragile nature and potential dehydration of the brain tissue due to drying in the ambient environment as well as to minimize analyte redistribution, a peltier cooling stage is integrated into the laesi imaging system. we demonstrate the utility of high resolution (m/m > 6000) time of flight mass spectrometry with laesi to deconvolute spatial distributions of different chemical species with identical nominal mass. to help with the evaluation of the massive data sets, pearson colocalization maps are calculated for selected small metabolites and lipids. we show that this approach reveals biologically meaningful correlations between these two classes of biomolecules.","Recently, based on focusing the mid infrared radiation through a sharpened optical fiber tip, LAESI MS of single plant and animal cells has also been demonstrated.

595,"diffusion controlled dissolution and precipitation reactions occur in many biological systems and some non stirred in vitro systems. previous studies have shown that differences in the diffusion rates of the ions involved in a dissolution/precipitation reaction can produce significant effects on the rate and course of the reaction. we report here results of a study that show inter diffusion of ions between two solutions, both saturated with respect to hydroxyapatite but with dissimilar compositions, resulted in one solution becoming undersaturated and the other supersaturated. a model is proposed that may explain the formation of a mineral dense layer in the caries process.","These results suggest that the rate of dissolution of tooth mineral in the lesion was faster than the rates of transport of acid ions into and/or the mineral ions out of the lesion.

596,"rats were trained to fear an auditory conditioned stimulus (cs) by pairing it with a mild electric shock (the unconditioned stimulus, or us) delivered to one eyelid. after training, the cs elicited two different conditioned fear responses from rats: a passive freezing response, and an active turning response. the balance between these two modes of conditioned responding depended upon the rat's recent history of encounters with the us. if rats had not recently encountered the us, then they responded to the cs by freezing. but after recently encountering the us, rats exhibited cs evoked turning responses that were always directed away from the trained eyelid, even if the us had recently been delivered to the opposite (untrained) eyelid. this post encounter turning behavior was not observed in rats that had been trained with unpaired presentations of the cs and us, indicating that even though cs evoked turning was selectively expressed after recent encounters with the us, it was nonetheless a conditioned pavlovian fear response that depended upon a learned association between the cs and us. further supporting this conclusion, pharmacological inactivation experiments showed that expression of both freezing and turning behaviors depended upon lateralized circuits in the amygdala and periaqueductal gray (pag) that are known to support expression of pavlovian fear responses. these findings indicate that even though the ability of a cs to elicit pavlovian fear responses depend upon the long term history of cs us pairings, the mode of conditioned responding (freezing versus turning in the present experiments) can be modulated by short term factors, such as the recent history of us encounters. we discuss neural mechanisms that might mediate such short term transitions between different modes of defensive responding, and consider how dysregulation of such mechanisms might contribute to clinical anxiety disorders.","An underlying assumption of such experiments is that expression of the measured responses is monotonically related to the intensity of conditioned fear (that is, more responding indicates more fear). But unlike freezing, the turning response is expressed selectively after recent encounters with the US, and not at other times.

598,"it is well established that the memory strength of studied items is more variable than the strength of new items on tests of recognition memory, but the reason why this occurs is poorly understood. one account for this old item variance effect is based on single process theory, which proposes that this effect is due to variability in how well items are initially encoded into memory (i.e., the encoding variability account). in contrast, dual process theory argues that old items are more variable because they are influenced by both recollection and familiarity, whereas recognition of new items relies primarily on familiarity. the current study shows that increasing encoding variability did not increase old item variance, and that old item variance is directly related to the contribution of recollection. these results indicate that old item memory variability is due to the relative contribution of recollection and familiarity.","According to this account, the variance of studied and non studied items recognized on the basis of familiarity is approximately equal.

Moreover, a review of the literature indicates that when appropriate instructions are used, remember/know judgments provide process measures that converge quite well with other measures of recollection, such as source discrimination or ROC estimates (; ; for review see ).

599,"purpose common practice in proton radiotherapy is to deliver a subset of all fields in the treatment plan on any given treatment day. we investigate using biological modeling if the resulting variation in daily dose to normal tissues has a relevant detrimental biological effect. methods and materials for four patient groups, the cumulative normalized total dose (ntd) was determined for normal tissues (oars) of each patient using the clinically delivered fractionation schedule (fsclin), and for hypothetical fractionation schedules delivering all fields every day (fsall) or only a single field each day (fssingle). cumulative 3d ntd distributions were summarized using the generalized equivalent uniform dose (geud) model. results for the skull base/cervical spine chordoma group, the largest effect is a gy increase in geud of the chiasm when treating only a subset of fields on any day. for lung cancer and pancreatic cancer patients the variation in the geud of normal tissues is less than 0.2 gy. for the prostate group, fsclin increases the geud of the femoral heads by gy compared to fsall. use of fssingle resulted in the highest ntd to normal tissues for any patient. fsall resulted in an integral ntd to the patient that is on average 5% lower than fsclin and 10% lower than fssingle. conclusion the effects of field set of the day treatment delivery depend on the tumor site and number of fields treated each day. modeling these effects may be important for accurate risk assessment.","This methodology of only delivering a field set of the day is often applied in clinical proton radiotherapy practice. As an example, shows dose volume histograms (DVH) for four unique treatment fractions of a single skull base/cervical spine chordoma cancer patient.

605,"summary recent advances in single cell assays have focused attention on the fact that even members of a genetically identical group of cells or organisms in identical environments can exhibit variability in drug sensitivity, cellular response, and phenotype. underlying much of this variability is stochasticity in gene expression, which can produce unique proteomes even in genetically identical cells. here we discuss the consequences of non genetic cell to cell variability in the cellular response to drugs and its potential impact for treatment of human disease.","These fluctuations cause genetically identical cells to vary significantly in their responsiveness to stimuli and drugs even in a uniform environment [,,,,,,,]. Such cell to cell differences arise from stochasticity in the biochemical reactions. Only recently has it become clear that intracellular biochemical fluctuations can also have profound effects on phenotype.When expressed in cells, activity sensitive fluorescent biosensors can report on protein protein association , protein conformation , protein cleavage , and protein modifications . Libraries of such cell lines have been used to correlate protein levels and localization in drug treated cells with cell fate . Non genetic cell to cell variability and the consequences for pharmacology 19833543 Linking protein expression levels to phenotype is most commonly performed using fixed and live cell microscopy.Nonetheless, there is every reason to believe that non genetic variability in the proteome will be recognized, alongside genetic changes and local environment, as an important factor in the development and treatment of human disease . Finally, the chemical master equation, which describes the probability that individual molecules will collide and react in a given time interval, can be approximated numerically using the Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA) or Gillespie Algorithm . For example, if we want to understand cell to cell variability in phenotype arising from differences in the levels of relatively abundant proteins, then we can combine deterministic models with distributions of initial protein concentrations and arrive at reasonable and useful approximations.","These fluctuations cause genetically identical cells to vary significantly in their responsiveness to stimuli and drugs even in a uniform environment [,,,,,,,].

607,"actin and tubulin cytoskeletal components are studied extensively in chondrocytes, but less is known about vimentin intermediate filaments. in other cell types, vimentin is a determinant of cell stiffness and disruption of vimentin networks weakens the mechanical integrity of cells. changes in vimentin organization correlate with osteoarthritis progression, but the functional consequences of these changes remain undetermined in chondrocytes. the objective of this study was to compare the contribution of vimentin to the mechanical stiffness of primary human chondrocytes isolated from normal versus osteoarthritic cartilage. chondrocytes were embedded in alginate and vimentin networks disrupted with acrylamide. constructs were imaged while subjected to 20% nominal strain on a confocal microscope stage, and the aspect ratios of approximately cells were measured. cytosolic stiffness was estimated with a finite element model, and live cell imaging of gfp vimentin was used to further analyze the nature of vimentin disruption. vimentin in normal chondrocytes formed an inner cage like network that was substantially stiffer than the rest of the cytosol and contributed significantly to overall cellular stiffness. disruption of vimentin reduced stiffness approximately 2.8 fold in normal chondrocytes. in contrast, osteoarthritic chondrocytes were less stiff and less affected by vimentin disruption. this 3d experimental system revealed contributions of vimentin to chondrocyte stiffness previously not apparent, and correlated changes in vimentin based chondrocyte stiffness with osteoarthritis.","We embedded unpassaged human chondrocytes from healthy and OA cartilage in hydrogel of known stiffness, then measured the cellular deformation using live cell imaging upon application of a 20% nominal strain.

608,"the foreign body response (fbr) comprises a general, ubiquitous host tissue based reaction to implanted materials. in vitro cell based models are frequently employed to study fbr mechanisms involving cell signaling responses to materials. however, these models often study only one cell type, identify only limited signals, and cannot accurately represent the complexity of in vivo inflammatory signaling. to address this issue, a cell co culture system involving two primary effector cells of the fbr, macrophages and fibroblasts, was employed. cell cell signaling systems were monitored between these cell types, including long term 1) culture of one cell type in conditioned media from the other cell type, 2) non contacting cell co cultures (paracrine signaling), and 3) contact co cultures (juxtacrine signaling) of primary and secondary derived cells. cell culture media and cell images were collected on days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, and and changes in soluble protein secretion, cellular behavior, and morphology were assessed. primary and secondary derived cells responded uniquely during each signaling scenario and to one another. in general higher in vitro fidelity to fbr like responses was found in primary cell co cultures compared to their mono cultures and all secondary cell cultures.","Consequently, in vitro models may be largely incapable of predicting and correlating in vivo phenotypes.

612,"summary serial block face imaging is a microscopy technique in which the top of a specimen is cut or ground away and a mosaic of images is collected of the newly revealed cross section. images collected from each slice are then digitally stacked to achieve three dimensional images. the development of fully automated image acquisition devices has made serial block face imaging more attractive by greatly reducing labor requirements. the technique is particularly attractive for studies of biological activity within cancellous bone as it has the capability of achieving direct, automated measures of biological and morphological traits and their associations with one another. when used with fluorescence microscopy, serial block face imaging has the potential to achieve 3d images of tissue as well as fluorescent markers of biological activity. epifluorescence based serial block face imaging presents a number of unique challenges for visualizing bone specimens due to noise generated by subsurface signal and local variations in tissue autofluorescence. here we present techniques for processing serial block face images of trabecular bone using a combination of non uniform illumination correction, precise tiling of the mosaic in each cross section, cross section alignment for vertical stacking, removal of subsurface signal, and segmentation. the resulting techniques allow examination of bone surface texture that will enable 3d quantitative measures of biological processes in cancellous bone biopsies.","Bone remodeling occurs at discrete locations on the bone surface and consists of a group of osteoclasts that remove a patch of bone, followed in time by a group of osteoblasts that form bone at the same location. Surface areas in bone, some of the most important types of measures, are commonly estimated from perimeter measurements using a geometric model . Histological examination of bone biopsies remains the only way to measure localized aspects of bone remodeling .We refer the reader to the original publication for a thorough description of the image acquisition device and comparison to other available approaches. Subsequently, a mosaic is created by aligning overlapping image regions using normalized cross correlation. First, non uniform illumination correction is applied to the images to equalize the contrast and intensity of the signals over each image field of view (FOV).High resolution images processed with the techniques described in the current study showed much smoother bone surfaces than those processed with previous techniques . Surface irregularities characteristic of osteoclast activity are readily visible in the grayscale and segmented images at 0.7 m resolution and are not visible in lower resolution images or images processed using previous techniques. No significant differences in bone volume fraction or bone specific surface (the ratio of bone surface to total specimen volume) were observed among images at 0.7 m/pixel resolution.","Bone remodeling occurs at discrete locations on the bone surface and consists of a group of osteoclasts that remove a patch of bone, followed in time by a group of osteoblasts that form bone at the same location.

613,"purpose to review recent developments in clinical aspects, molecular geneticsand pathogenesis of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (arvc). recent findings arvc is a primary disease of the myocardium characterized by fibro adipocytic replacement of myocytes, predominantly in the right ventricle. phenotypic expression of arvc is variable and a significant number of patients may exhibit a subtle phenotype, particularly in the early stages of the disease. mutations in dsp, jup, pkp2, dsg2 and dsc2; encoding desmosomal proteins desmoplakin (dp), plakoglobin (pg), plakophilin (pkp2), desmoglein (dsg2), and desmocollin (dsc2), respectively, cause arvc. thus, arvc, at least in a subset, is a disease of desmosomes. in addition, mutations in tmem43 and tgfb1 have been associated with arvc. mechanistic studies indicate that suppressed canonical wnt signaling, imposed by nuclear pg, is the responsible mechanism for the pathogenesis of arvc. it leads to the differentiation of a subset of second heart field cardiac progenitor cells at the epicardium to adipocytes due to enhanced expression of adipogenic factors. this mechanism explains the predominant involvement of the right ventricle in arvc. hence, arvc is the first identified disease of disrupted differentiation of cardiac progenitor cells. summary advances in molecular genetics and the pathogenesis of arvc could afford the opportunity for a genetic based diagnosis and development of novel diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets aimed to prevent, attenuate and reverse the evolving phenotype.","The left ventricle is commonly spared in early stages of the disease but is often involved in advanced stages or is the predominant chamber involved [, ] .

614,"objective we examined the etiology of two disordered eating characteristics. method participants included female adolescent and young adult twins and their female non twin siblings. phenotypic factor analyses of a seven item eating pathology screening tool yielded two factors: weight and shape concerns and behaviors (wscb) and binge eating (be). univariate and bivariate extended twin analyses (including co twins and non twin siblings) were used to estimate the magnitude of genetic and environmental influences on these characteristics. results analyses indicated that individual differences in wscb and be could be explained by additive genetic influences (a2 = 0.43 (95% ci: 0.330.52) and 0.49 (95% ci: 0.360.58), respectively), with the remaining variance due to non shared environmental influences. the genetic correlation between wscb and be was estimated at 0.64; the non shared environmental correlation was estimated at 0.27. conclusions these results corroborate previous findings on genetic and environmental influences on disordered eating characteristics and suggest that findings can be extended to non twin populations.","This study aimed at extending previous literature in two ways. Investigations of genetic and environmental influences on disordered eating characteristics have primarily relied on the classical twin design (e.g., references ). To date, no study has directly investigated the potential for common etiological factors underlying binge eating and weight/shape concerns .Model comparisons indicated that the CE and E models were the only models that could be clearly rejected by 2 difference tests for both WSCB and BE.

615,"determination of glomerular filtration rate (gfr) is a valuable, yet underused, diagnostic tool for evaluating renal function in dogs and cats. this article first reviews the hormonal and hemodynamic factors which contribute to gfr, followed by a description of considerations when selecting a pharmacokinetic model and methods of animal to animal standardization. the best characterized existing gfr markers, including creatinine, radiolabeled markers, and iohexol, are reviewed in depth, as well as alternative but lesser used techniques. a weighted means analysis of reported gfr measurements in healthy dogs and cats and a review of selected studies that have examined gfr alterations in animals with naturally occurring and experimental diseases provide the reader with preliminary guidelines on expected gfr results in these species and disease conditions.","Despite its superiority for detecting early renal dysfunction, measurement of GFR remains an underused tool in the diagnosis and management of kidney disease in veterinary medicine. Serum creatinine concentration has replaced GFR measurement in most clinical settings because of its ease and widespread availability; however, because serum creatinine likely does not increase above reference range until approximately 75% of nephrons are nonfunctional, and falsely increased creatinine concentrations may occur with some assays, the sensitivity and specificity of creatinine for diagnosis of kidney disease should be considered inferior to actual determination of GFR . There are several situations where determination of GFR may be theoretically useful in clinical patients.For example, variability for the exo iohexol isomer in cats and for 99mTc DTPA renal scintigraphic uptake in dogs is between 7.0 and 9.0% , whereas variability for the endo iohexol isomer in cats and exogenous creatinine clearance following intravenous bolus administration is between 14.0 and 17.5% . Alternatively, extrarenal clearance of creatinine may theoretically falsely increase GFR results; however extrarenal elimination of creatinine in one study was insignificant (i.e. < 1%) . However, changes in GFR that occur with those conditions which may have some effect on kidney function without commonly resulting in azotemia, such as lymphoma or neoplasia in general, or during and following anesthesia of patients with concurrent metabolic derangements, still require further characterization .Although GFR measurement allows earlier detection of renal disease than other available assays, it is still a highly underutilized tool in dogs and cats. Simplification of assay protocols has been attempted by validating new markers and modifying sampling methods. However, lack of standardization of protocols and concerns about reproducibility of results make comparison of results from different laboratories difficult.","Despite its superiority for detecting early renal dysfunction, measurement of GFR remains an underused tool in the diagnosis and management of kidney disease in veterinary medicine.

617,"resistance to 5 fluorouracil (5 fu) represents a major contributor to cancer related mortality in advanced colorectal cancer patients. genetic variations and expression alterations in genes involved in 5 fu metabolism and effect have been shown to modulate 5 fu sensitivity in vitro, however these alterations do not fully explain clinical resistance to 5 fu based chemotherapy. to determine if alterations of dna copy number in genes involved in 5 fu metabolism impacted clinical resistance to 5 fu based chemotherapy, we assessed thymidylate synthetase (tyms) and thymidine phosphorylase (tymp) copy number in colorectal liver metastases. dna copy number of tyms and tymp was evaluated using real time quantitative pcr in frozen colorectal liver metastases procured from patients who were pretreated with 5 fu based chemotherapy prior to surgical resection (5 fu exposed) and from patients who received no pretreatment (unexposed). gain of tyms dna copy number was observed in 18% of the 5 fu exposed metastases, while only 4% of the unexposed metastases exhibited tyms copy gain (p=0.036). no significant differences were noted in tymp copy number alterations between 5 fu exposed and unexposed metastases. median survival time was similar in 5 fu exposed patients with metastases containing tyms amplification and those with no amplification. however, tyms amplification was associated with shorter median survival in patients receiving post resection chemotherapy (hazard ratio = 2.7, 95% confidence interval = 1.1 to 6.6; p=0.027). these results suggest amplification of tyms amplification as a putative mechanism for clinical resistance to 5 fu based chemotherapy and may have important ramifications for the post resection chemotherapy choices for metastatic colorectal cancer.","One major focus has been the enzyme, thymidylate synthetase (TYMS), a key therapeutic target of 5 FU.

These results indicate that for each one millisecond increase in Stroop performance, there is a 1% increase in the odds of a suicide attempt. Those included were slightly younger (M=34.5, SD=11.8) than those excluded (M=38.7, SD=12.5), t(193)=2.3, p=.02, d=0.33.This research was supported by grants from the National Institute of Mental Health. First, many participants were excluded due to the Stroop scoring criteria, and those included in this study were younger than those excluded. These characteristics were assessed over time frames of lifetime, past year, past month, and past week.",0.3116883116883117,0.04699738903394256,0.17035704677420163,0.3116883116883117,0.04699738903394256,0.17035704677420163
625,"objective igf 1 stimulates cartilage repair but is not a practical therapy due to its short half life. we have previously modified igf 1 by adding a heparin binding domain and have shown that this fusion protein (hb igf 1) stimulates sustained proteoglycan synthesis in cartilage. here, we first examined the mechanism by which hb igf 1 is retained in cartilage. we then tested whether hb igf 1 provides sustained growth factor delivery to cartilage in vivo and to human cartilage explants. methods retention of hb igf 1 and igf 1 was analyzed by western blotting. the requirement of heparan sulfate (hs) or chondroitin sulfate (cs) glycosaminoglycans for binding was tested using enzymatic removal and cells with genetic deficiency of hs. binding affinities of hb igf 1 and igf 1 proteins for isolated glycosaminoglycans were examined by surface plasmon resonance and elisa. results in cartilage explants, chondroitinase treatment decreased binding of hb igf 1, whereas heparitinase had no effect. furthermore, hs was not necessary for hb igf 1 retention on cell monolayers. binding assays showed that hb igf 1 bound both cs and hs, whereas igf 1 did not bind either. after intra articular injection in rat knees, hb igf 1 was retained in articular and meniscal cartilages, but not in tendon, consistent with enhanced delivery to cs rich cartilage. finally, hb igf 1 but not igf 1 was retained in human cartilage explants. conclusions after intra articular injection in rats, hb igf 1 is specifically retained in cartilage through its high abundance of cs. modification of growth factors with heparin binding domains may be a new strategy for sustained and specific local delivery to cartilage.","Insulin like growth factor I (IGF 1) is known to be an important anabolic factor in cartilage homeostasis . A successful IGF 1 delivery strategy must overcome two major obstacles. This result led us to test whether intra articular injection of HB IGF 1 allows sustained in vivo delivery preferentially to CS rich rat knee cartilage and whether HB IGF 1 can bind adult human cartilage .To examine whether HB IGF 1 may be relevant as a strategy for clinical delivery of growth factors to cartilage, we tested whether HB IGF 1 could also be retained in post mortem adult human cartilage explants. Human knee cartilage obtained from three Collins grade 0 donor joints (both male and female) and one Collins grade 2 joint (female) was incubated with 500 nM HB IGF 1 or IGF 1 for two days, washed with PBS, and incubated in no IGF 1 medium for an additional 0, 1, 2, or 4 days.

629,"background although numerous studies have assessed subjective effects of nitrous oxide, few studies have analyzed for sex differences. since sex differences have been reported in subjective effects of several drugs such as opioids, nicotine and alcohol, we sought to determine if sex modulates the subjective effects of the inhalant, nitrous oxide, in healthy volunteers. methods thirty eight females and seventy two males from nine studies that were conducted in our laboratory were included in this retrospective analysis. all experimental studies utilized randomized, placebo controlled, repeated measures designs in which subjects inhaled 30% nitrous oxide in oxygen and 100% oxygen (placebo). dependent measures in this analysis were subjective effects measured at baseline and min into the inhalation period. results nitrous oxide produced a number of subjective effects, including those that could be considered abuse liability related (elated, having pleasant thoughts, drug liking), but sex did not modulate these effects. conclusions females and males showed similar subjective responses to 30% nitrous oxide. future prospective studies might assess other concentrations, other measures (choice, analgesic response), and other inhaled general anesthetics to more comprehensively characterize the role of sex in response to inhalants.","However, this study did not utilize a placebo control condition.

630,"over the past two decades, the bulk of gastrointestinal (gi) endoscopic procedures has shifted away from diagnostic and therapeutic interventions for symptomatic disease toward cancer prevention in asymptomatic patients. this shift has resulted largely from a decrease in the incidence of peptic ulcer disease in the era of antisecretory medications coupled with emerging evidence for the efficacy of endoscopic detection and eradication of dysplasia, a histopathological biomarker widely accepted as a precursor to cancer. this shift has been accompanied by a drive toward minimally invasive, in situ optical diagnostic technologies that help assess the mucosa for cellular changes that relate to dysplasia. two competing but complementary approaches have been pursued. the first approach is based on broad view targeting of areas of interest or red flags. these broad view technologies include standard white light endoscopy (wle), high definition endoscopy (hd), and electronic chromoendoscopy (narrow band type imaging). the second approach is based on multiple small area or point source (meso/micro) measurements, which can be either machine (spectroscopy) or human interpreted (endomicroscopy, magnification endoscopy), much as histopatholgy slides are. in this paper we present our experience with the development and testing of a set of familiar but smarter standard tissue sampling tools that can be routinely employed during screening/surveillance endoscopy. these tools have been designed to incorporate fiberoptic probes that can mediate spectroscopy or endomicroscopy. we demonstrate the value of such tools by assessing their preliminary performance from several ongoing clinical studies. our results have shown promise for a new generation of integrated optical tools for a variety of screening/surveillance applications during gi endoscopy. integrated devices should prove invaluable for dysplasia surveillance strategies that currently result in large numbers of benign biopsies, which are of little clinical consequence, including screening for colorectal polyps and surveillance of flat dysplasia such as barretts esophagus and chronic colitis due to inflammatory bowel diseases.","Scattering is generated by gradients of the optical index of refraction and ESS spectral signatures will be altered if the refractive index of subcellular structures changes, say, due to an increase in the amount and/or granularity of chromatin.

640,"this study examined the associations between prenatal cocaine exposure and quality of mother infant play interactions at months of infant ages. we investigated whether maternal psychological distress and infant reactivity mediated or moderated this association. participants consisted of (119 cocaine exposed, non cocaine exposed) mother infant dyads participating in an ongoing longitudinal study of prenatal cocaine exposure. results indicated that mothers who used cocaine during pregnancy displayed higher negative affect and lower sensitivity toward their infant during play interactions at months, and that their infants were less responsive toward them. contrary to hypothesis, this association was not mediated by maternal psychological distress or by infant reactivity. however, results for both the cocaine and non cocaine exposed infants were supportive of a transactional model where lower maternal sensitivity at month was predictive of higher infant reactivity at months, which in turn was predictive of lower maternal warmth/sensitivity at months, controlling for potential stability in maternal behavior. results also indicated that as hypothesized, infant reactivity moderated the association between maternal cocaine use during pregnancy and maternal warmth/sensitivity at months of age. cocaine using mothers who experienced their infants as being more reactive in early infancy were less warm/sensitive toward them in later infancy. results have implications for parenting interventions that may be targeted toward improving maternal sensitivity among cocaine using mothers with more reactive infants.","However, the literature is by no means unequivocal.

641,"the purpose of this study was to characterize the viscoelastic behavior of diabetic and non diabetic plantar soft tissue at six ulcer prone/load bearing locations beneath the foot to determine any changes that may play a role in diabetic ulcer formation and subsequent amputation in this predisposed population. four older diabetic and four control fresh frozen cadaveric feet were each dissected to isolate plantar tissue specimens from the hallux, first, third, and fifth metatarsals, lateral midfoot, and calcaneus. stress relaxation experiments were used to quantify the viscoelastic tissue properties by fitting the data to the quasi linear viscoelastic (qlv) theory using two methods, a traditional frequency insensitive approach and an indirect frequency sensitive approach, and by measuring several additional parameters from the raw data including the rate and amount of overall relaxation. the stress relaxation response of both diabetic and non diabetic specimens was unexpectedly similar and accordingly few of the qlv parameters for either fit approach and none of raw data parameters differed. likewise, no differences were found between plantar locations. the accuracy of both fit methods was comparable, however, neither approach predicted the ramp behavior. further, fit coefficients varied considerably from one method to the other, making it hard to discern meaningful trends. future testing using alternate loading modes and intact feet may provide more insight into the role that time dependent properties play in diabetic foot ulceration.","The QLV theory has been modified over the years such that there are many implementation approaches to be considered.

645,"up to date, no consensus has been achieved regarding the possibility of detecting neuronal currents by mri (ncmri) in human brain. to evaluate the detectability of ncmri, an effective way is to simulate ncmri signal with the realistic neuronal geometry and electrophysiological processes. unfortunately, previous realistic ncmri models are based on rat and monkey neurons. the species difference in neuronal morphology and physiology would prevent these models from simulating the ncmri signal accurately in human subjects. the aim of the present study is to bridge this gap by establishing a realistic ncmri model specifically for human cerebral cortex. in this model, the ncmri signal was simulated using anatomically reconstructed human pyramidal neurons and their biophysical properties. the modeling results showed that the amplitude of ncmri signal significantly depends on the density of synchronously firing neurons and imaging conditions such as position of imaging voxel, direction of main magnetic field (b0) relative to the cortical surface and echo time. the results indicated that physiologically evoked ncmri signal is too weak to be detected (magnitude/phase change 1.4106/0.02), but the phase signal induced by spontaneous activity may reach a detectable level (up to 0.2) in favorable conditions.","Therefore, the results from the previous realistic ncMRI models are unable to resolve the debate on the feasibility of ncMRI in human subjects completely. On the other hand, this simplification may significantly degrade the simulation accuracy . Since these realistic ncMRI models are able to simulate the temporal and spatial distributions of neuronal currents more accurately, in principle they would provide a more accurate tool to predict the size of ncMRI signal .This phenomenon also appears in the simulation results in the previous ncMRI models and it is caused by the back propagation of action potentials .

648,"backscattering measurements for acoustically trapped lipid droplets were undertaken by employing a p[vdf trfe] broadband transducer of f number = 1, with a bandwidth of 112%. the wide bandwidth allowed the transmission of the mhz trapping signal and the mhz sensing signal using the same transducer. tone bursts at mhz were first transmitted by the transducer to hold a single droplet at the focus (or the center of the trap) and separate it from its neighboring droplets by translating the transducer perpendicularly to the beam axis. subsequently, mhz probing pulses were sent to the trapped droplet and the backscattered rf echo signal received by the same transducer. the measured beam width at mhz was measured to be m. the integrated backscatter (ib) coefficient of an individual droplet was determined within the 6 db bandwidth of the transmit pulse by normalizing the power spectrum of the rf signal to the reference spectrum obtained from a flat reflector. the mean ib coefficient for droplets with a m average diameter (denoted as cluster a) was db, whereas it was db for 90 m droplets (cluster b). the standard deviation was 0.9 db for each cluster. the experimental values were then compared with those computed with the t matrix method and a good agreement was found: the difference was as small as db for both clusters. these results suggest that this approach might be useful as a means for measuring ultrasonic backscattering from a single microparticle, and illustrate the potential of acoustic sensing for cell sorting.","Both narrowband and wideband substitution methods have been employed to quantitatively estimate the backscattering properties by measuring the ratio between the magnitudes of RF signals from a reflector of known reflectivity and a sample volume of interest in a tissue.

Demographic and clinical characteristics were recorded from first responder and medical examiner reports as well as medical records. Documented CAD was defined as history of myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, or at least 50% stenosis on coronary angiography .For controls, ECGs were obtained more than 14 days prior to the ascertainment day in 32% (n = 162 controls), more than 14 days post ascertainment in 38% (n = 198) and within 14 days of ascertainment in 30% (n = 158).

659,"mucolipidosis type iv (mliv) is a neurodevelopmental as well as neurodegenerative disorder with severe psychomotor developmental delay, progressive visual impairment, and achlorydria. it is characterized by the presence of lysosomal inclusions in many cell types in patients. mliv is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in mcoln1, which encodes for mucolipin 1, a member of the transient receptor potential (trp) cation channel family. although approximately 70 80% of patients identified are ashkenazi jewish, mliv is a pan ethnic disorder. importantly, while mliv is thought to be a rare disease, its frequency may be greater than currently appreciated, for its common presentation as a cerebral palsy like encephalopathy can lead to misdiagnosis. moreover, patients with milder variants are often not recognized as having mliv. this review provides an update on the ethnic distribution, clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, methods of diagnosis, molecular genetics, differential diagnosis, and treatment of patients with mliv. an enhanced awareness of the manifestations of this disorder may help to elucidate the true frequency and range of symptoms associated with mliv, providing insight into the pathogenesis of this multi system disease.","Additionally, milder variants of MLIV exist that can go undiagnosed, furthering the perception that MLIV is an extremely rare disease [ ].

661,"conspectus nanoparticles conjugated with functional ligands are expected to have a major impact in medicine, photonics, sensing, and nanoarchitecture design. one major obstacle to realizing the promise of these materials, however, is the difficulty in controlling the ligand/nanoparticle ratio. this obstacle can be segmented into three key areas: first, many system designs have failed to account for the true heterogeneity of ligand/nanoparticle ratios that compose each material. second, the field's accepted level of characterization of ligand nanoparticle materials is deficient as it does not provide an accurate definition of material composition that is necessary to both understand the material property relationships as well as to monitor the consistency of the material. in particular, many characterization assays only determine the mean ligand/nanoparticle ratio and do not provide the number and relative amount of the different ligand/nanoparticle ratios that compose a material. third, some synthetic approaches that are presently in use may not produce consistent material as they are sensitive to reaction kinetics, and the synthetic history of the nanoparticle. in this account we describe the recent advances that we have made in understanding the material composition of ligand nanoparticle systems. our work has been enabled by a model system using poly(amidoamine) dendrimers and two small molecule ligands. using reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography (hplc) we have successfully resolved and quantified the relative amount of each ligand/dendrimer ratio present. this type of information is rare for the entire field of ligand nanoparticle materials because most analytical techniques have been unable to identify the components in the distribution. our experimental data indicates that the actual distribution of ligand nanoparticle components is much more heterogeneous than commonly assumed. the mean ligand/nanoparticle ratio that is so often the only information known about a material is insufficient. this is because the mean does not provide information on the diversity of components in the material and often does not describe the most common component (the mode). additionally, our experimental data has provided examples of material batches with the same mean ligand/nanoparticle ratio and very different distributions. this discrepancy indicates that the mean cannot be used as the sole metric to assess the reproducibility of a system. we further found that distribution profiles can be highly sensitive to the synthetic history of the starting material as well as slight changes in reaction conditions. we have incorporated the lessons from our experimental data into new systems designs to provide improved control over the ligand/nanoparticle ratios.","Our efforts in characterizing and defining ligand nanoparticle distributions have been greatly facilitated by two ligand nanoparticle systems for which the distribution of components can be resolved by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). This analysis is generally applicable to ligand nanoparticle systems where in the ligand is conjugated with an excess of attachment sites on the nanoparticle and where the ligand is small relative to the nanoparticle such that site blocking is limited to the single attachment site. The results of this work provide important information regarding questions of adequate characterization and also provide valuable insight into batch reproducibility challenges that several of these systems face .These different batches were produced under supposedly the same experimental conditions and yet they introduced a high level of variability into the system. The entire field of polymers, for example, has confronted this challenge for more than a century. Not only does this approach bypass the poor control present in the partial acetylation reaction, it also may make functional ligand distributions less sensitive to varying amounts of dendrimer defect structures in different commercial lots .Where possible, the present reliance on the mean number of ligands per dendrimer should be replaced with a full characterization of the entire distribution of ligand/particle ratios. using reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography (hplc) we have successfully resolved and quantified the relative amount of each ligand/dendrimer ratio present.

662,"rationale the standardized use of a stethoscope for chest auscultation in clinical research is limited by its inherent inter listener variability. electronic auscultation and automated classification of recorded lung sounds may help prevent some these shortcomings. objective we sought to perform a systematic review and meta analysis of studies implementing computerized lung sounds analysis (clsa) to aid in the detection of abnormal lung sounds for specific respiratory disorders. methods we searched for articles on clsa in medline, embase, cochrane library and isi web of knowledge through july 31, 2010. following qualitative review, we conducted a meta analysis to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of clsa for the detection of abnormal lung sounds. measurements and main results of articles identified, we selected eight studies for review. most studies employed either electret microphones or piezoelectric sensors for auscultation, and fourier transform and neural network algorithms for analysis and automated classification of lung sounds. overall sensitivity for the detection of wheezes or crackles using clsa was 80% (95% ci 7286%) and specificity was 85% (95% ci 7891%). conclusions while quality data on clsa are relatively limited, analysis of existing information suggests that clsa can provide a relatively high specificity for detecting abnormal lung sounds such as crackles and wheezes. further research and product development could promote the value of clsa in research studies or its diagnostic utility in clinical setting.","The Fourier transform is the most commonly used spectral analysis algorithm to provide information on the frequency components of a signal.

663,"the objective of this paper is to assess the contribution of disease activity, pain, and psychological factors to self reported sleep disturbance in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra), and to evaluate whether depression mediates the effects of pain on sleep disturbance. the sample included patients with confirmed ra participated in an assessment of their disease activity, pain, psychological functioning, and sleep disturbance during a baseline evaluation prior to participating in a prospective study to help them manage their ra. self measures included the rapid assessment of disease activity in rheumatology (radar), the sf 36 pain scale, the helplessness and internality subscales of the arthritis helplessness index (ahi), the active and passive pain coping scales of the pain management inventory (pmi), the center for epidemiological studies depression scale (ces d), and the pittsburgh sleep quality index (psqi). hierarchical multiple regression analysis confirmed that higher income, pain, internality, and depression contributed independently to higher sleep disturbance. a mediational analysis demonstrated that depression acted as a significant mechanism through which pain contributed to sleep disturbance. cross sectional findings indicate that pain and depression play significant roles in self reported sleep disturbance among patients with ra. the data suggest the importance of interventions that target pain and depression to improve sleep in this medical condition.","Importantly, sleep disturbance may contribute to greater pain, disease activity, and mood disturbance, creating a cascade of dysfunction for afflicted patients . A key issue in this research concerns the relative influence of these variables on sleep. A clearer understanding of the factors contributing to sleep disturbance in RA would inform the development of rational, empirically based treatments to improve sleep in this patient population .The purpose of this strategy was to isolate the contribution of each block of factors to sleep disturbance after controlling for all variables entered on preceding blocks. Finally, a model that examined whether depressive symptoms mediated the effects of pain on sleep disturbance was evaluated . To establish the best set of predictor variables, bivariate correlation analyses were conducted.The cross sectional nature of the findings precluded an understanding of the directionality between pain, depression, and sleep disturbance. The results suggest that sleep disturbance in RA may result, in part, from a cyclical pattern in which heightened pain creates risk for mood disturbance that, in turn, interferes with sleep. Differences between the two scales in the approach to the measurement of pain could have been responsible for this result.","Importantly, sleep disturbance may contribute to greater pain, disease activity, and mood disturbance, creating a cascade of dysfunction for afflicted patients .

664,"summary it is proposed that caloric restriction (cr) increases mitochondrial biogenesis. however, it is not clear why cr increases an energetically costly biosynthetic process. we hypothesized that 40% cr would decrease mitochondrial protein synthesis and would be regulated by translational rather than transcriptional mechanisms. we assessed cumulative mitochondrial protein synthesis over weeks and its transcriptional and translational regulation in the liver, heart, and skeletal muscle of young (6 mo), middle (12 mo), and old (24 mo) male b6d2f1 mice that were lifelong cr or ad lib (al) controls. mitochondrial protein synthesis was not different between al and cr (fractional synthesis over 6 weeks (range): liver 100%, heart 7485% skeletal muscle 5372%) despite a decreased cellular proliferation in liver and heart with cr. with cr there was an increase in amp activated protein kinase (ampk) phosphorylation:total (p:t) in heart and liver, and an increase in peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 (pgc 1) mrna in all tissues, but not protein. ribosomal protein s6 (rps6) was decreased with cr. in conclusion, cr maintained mitochondrial protein synthesis while decreasing cellular proliferation during a time of energetic stress, which is consistent with the concept that cr increases somatic maintenance. alternative mechanisms to global translation initiation may be responsible for selective translation of mitochondrial proteins.","Content on the other hand is the balance of synthesis and breakdown.

666,"background therapeutic hypothermia has been shown to reduce neurological morbidity and mortality in the setting of out of hospital cardiac arrest and may be beneficial following brain injury and cardiopulmonary bypass. we conducted a systematic review to ascertain the effect of therapeutic hypothermia on development of acute kidney injury (aki) and mortality. methods we searched for randomized controlled trials in medline through february 2011. we included trials comparing hypothermia to normothermia that reported kidney related outcomes including, development of aki, dialysis requirement, changes in serum creatinine, and mortality. we performed peto fixed effect and random effects model meta analyses, and meta regressions. results nineteen trials reporting on 2,218 patients were included; in the normothermia group, the weighted rate of aki was 4.2%, dialysis requirement 3.7%, and mortality 10.8%. by meta analysis, hypothermia was not associated with a lower odds of aki (odds ratio [or] 1.01, 95% confidence interval [ci] 0.68, 1.51; p = 0.95) or dialysis requirement (or 0.81; 95% ci 0.30, 2.19; p = 0.68); however, by meta regression, a lower target cooling temperature was associated with a lower odds of aki (p = 0.01). hypothermia was associated with lower mortality (or 0.69; 95% ci 0.51, 0.92; p = 0.01). conclusions in trials that ascertained kidney endpoints, therapeutic hypothermia prevented neither the development of aki nor dialysis requirement, but was associated with lower mortality. different definitions and rates of aki, differences in mortality rates, and concerns about the optimal target cooling temperature preclude definitive conclusions.","On the basis of the published evidence, the Advanced Life Support Task Force of the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation has adopted therapeutic hypothermia into its guidelines for the treatment of unconscious adult patients with spontaneous circulation after out of hospital cardiac arrest .

669,"the quality of life of leg amputees can be improved dramatically by using a cyber physical system (cps) that controls artificial legs based on neural signals representing amputees intended movements. the key to the cps is the neural machine interface (nmi) that senses electromyographic (emg) signals to make control decisions. this paper presents a design and implementation of a novel nmi using an embedded computer system to collect neural signals from a physical system a leg amputee, provide adequate computational capability to interpret such signals, and make decisions to identify users intent for prostheses control in real time. a new deciphering algorithm, composed of an emg pattern classifier and a post processing scheme, was developed to identify the users intended lower limb movements. to deal with environmental uncertainty, a trust management mechanism was designed to handle unexpected sensor failures and signal disturbances. integrating the neural deciphering algorithm with the trust management mechanism resulted in a highly accurate and reliable software system for neural control of artificial legs. the software was then embedded in a newly designed hardware platform based on an embedded microcontroller and a graphic processing unit (gpu) to form a complete nmi for real time testing. real time experiments on a leg amputee subject and an able bodied subject have been carried out to test the control accuracy of the new nmi. our extensive experiments have shown promising results on both subjects, paving the way for clinical feasibility of neural controlled artificial legs.","A complete prototype has been built implementing all the software and hardware functionalities.

670,"infants and their mothers participated in a longitudinal study of the sequelae of infant goal blockage responses. four month old infants participated in a standard contingency learning/goal blockage procedure during which anger and sad facial expressions to the blockage were coded. when infants were 12 and 20 months old, mothers completed a questionnaire about their children's tantrums. tantrum scores increased with age and boys tended to show more tantrum behavior than girls. anger expressed to goal blockage at months was unrelated to tantrum behavior. there was a gender by sad expression interaction. girls who expressed sadness in response to the goal blockage had lower total tantrum scores than boys; otherwise there was no difference. these results suggest that tantrums of infants who display sad, not anger expression, in response to goal blockage, are differentially influenced by children's gender.","Infants who focus on goals and persist in attempts to regain them can be characterized as being strongly engaged in the environment and therefore high in behavioral approach.

671,"we introduce atropos, an itk based multivariate n class open source segmentation algorithm distributed with ants (http://www.picsl.upenn.edu/ants). the bayesian formulation of the segmentation problem is solved using the expectation maximization (em) algorithm with the modeling of the class intensities based on either parametric or non parametric finite mixtures. atropos is capable of incorporating spatial prior probability maps (sparse), prior label maps and/or markov random field (mrf) modeling. atropos has also been efficiently implemented to handle large quantities of possible labelings (in the experimental section, we use up to classes) with a minimal memory footprint. this work describes the technical and implementation aspects of atropos and evaluates its performance on two different ground truth datasets. first, we use the brainweb dataset from montreal neurological institute to evaluate three tissue segmentation performance via (1) k means segmentation without use of template data; (2) mrf segmentation with initialization by prior probability maps derived from a group template; (3) prior based segmentation with use of spatial prior probability maps derived from a group template. we also evaluate atropos performance by using spatial priors to drive a 69 class em segmentation problem derived from the hammers atlas from university college london. these evaluation studies, combined with illustrative examples that exercise atropos options, demonstrate both performance and wide applicability of this new platform independent open source segmentation tool.","Recently, reseachers have begun to rely on spatial prior probability maps of anatomical structures of interest to encode domain knowledge (; ; ).

672,"we developed a rapid kinetic bioassay demonstrating the inhibition of glutathione peroxidase (gpx 1) by organic electrophilic pollutants such as acrolein, crotonaldehyde, and p benzoquinone that are frequently found as components of tobacco smoke, diesel exhaust, and other combustion sources. in a complementary approach, we applied a high resolution proton transfer reaction time of flight mass spectrometer (ptr tof ms) to monitor in real time the generation of electrophilic volatile carbonyls in cigarette smoke. the new bioassay uses the important antioxidant selenoenzyme gpx 1, immobilized to 96 well microtiter plates, as a probe. the selenocysteine bearing subunits of the enzyme's catalytic site are viewed as cysteine analogues and are vulnerable to electrophilic attack by compounds with conjugated carbonyl systems. the immobilization of gpx 1 to microtiter plate wells enabled facile removal of excess reactive inhibitory compounds after incubation with electrophilic chemicals or aqueous extracts of air samples derived from different sources. the inhibitory response of cigarette smoke and diesel exhaust particle extracts were compared to chemical standards of a group of electrophilic carbonyls and the arylating p benzoquinone. gpx 1 activity was directly inactivated by millimolar concentrations of highly reactive electrophilic chemicals (including acrolein, glyoxal, methylglyoxal, and p benzoquinone) and extracts of diesel and cigarette smoke. we conclude that the potential of air pollutant components to generate oxidative stress may be, in part, a result of electrophile derived covalent modifications of enzymes involved in the cytosolic antioxidant defense.","Exposure to reactive chemicals may trigger a cascade of biological oxidative stress responses including NF B (nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cells) activation, and cytokine or chemokine mediated signaling .

674,"facial beauty has both important social and biological implications. research has shown that people tend to look longer at attractive than unattractive faces. however, little is known about whether an attractive face presented outside foveal vision can capture attention. the effect of facial attractiveness on covert attention was investigated in a spatial cuing task. participants were asked to judge the orientation of a cued target presented to the left or right visual field while ignoring a task irrelevant face image flashed in the opposite field. relative to unattractive faces, the presence of attractive faces significantly lengthened task performance. the results suggest that facial beauty automatically competes with an ongoing cognitive task for spatial attention.","Other studies have shown that participants tend to look longer at attractive than unattractive faces or take longer to decide on the attractiveness of attractive than unattractive faces . Participants were told that the face was task irrelevant. However, unlike the study of attention to emotions, there has been little investigation into the relationship between facial attractiveness and attention .The letter T was either shown upright or inverted. Participants were also reminded to maintain central fixation throughout the trials .

686,"many estimation tasks require bayesian classifiers capable of adjusting their performance (e.g. sensitivity/specificity). in situations where the optimal classification decision can be identified by an exhaustive search over all possible classes, means for adjusting classifier performance, such as probability thresholding or weighting the a posteriori probabilities, are well established. unfortunately, analogous methods compatible with markov random fields (i.e. large collections of dependent random variables) are noticeably absent from the literature. consequently, most markov random field (mrf) based classification systems typically restrict their performance to a single, static operating point (i.e. a paired sensitivity/specificity). to address this deficiency, we previously introduced an extension of maximum posterior marginals (mpm) estimation that allows certain classes to be weighted more heavily than others, thus providing a means for varying classifier performance. however, this extension is not appropriate for the more popular maximum a posteriori (map) estimation. thus, a strategy for varying the performance of map estimators is still needed. such a strategy is essential for several reasons: 1) the map cost function may be more appropriate in certain classification tasks than the mpm cost function, 2) the literature provides a surfeit of map estimation implementations, several of which are considerably faster than the typical markov chain monte carlo methods used for mpm, and 3) map estimation is used far more often than mpm. consequently, in this paper we introduce multiplicative weighted map (mwmap) estimation achieved via the incorporation of multiplicative weights into the map cost function which allows certain classes to be preferred over others. this creates a natural bias for specific classes, and consequently a means for adjusting classifier performance. similarly, we show how this multiplicative weighting strategy can be applied to the mpm cost function (in place of the strategy we presented previously), yielding multiplicative weighted mpm (mwmpm) estimation. furthermore, we describe how mwmap and mwmpm can be implemented using adaptations of current estimation strategies such as iterated conditional modes and mpm monte carlo. to illustrate these implementations, we first integrate them into two separate mrf based classification systems for detecting carcinoma of the prostate (cap) on 1) digitized histological sections from radical prostatectomies and 2) t2 weighted tesla ex vivo prostate mri. to highlight the extensibility of mwmap and mwmpm to estimation tasks involving more than two classes, we also incorporate these estimation criteria into a mrf based classifier used to segment synthetic brain mr images. in the context of these tasks, we show how our novel estimation criteria can be used to arbitrarily adjust the sensitivities of these systems, yielding receiver operator characteristic curves (and surfaces).","Unfortunately, analogous methods compatible with MRFs are noticeably absent in the literature.

694,"cataract is a key factor in the morbidity associated with diabetes. while the pathogenesis of diabetic cataract formation is poorly understood, previous research has identified aldose reductase (alr2) as a key player. to elucidate a potential role for this enzyme in diabetic cataract formation, we created a series of transgenic mice designed for expression of human alr2 (akr1b1) in epithelial and outer cortical fiber cells of the lens. one of the founder lines, designated par39, developed an early onset cataract that involved formation of a plaque of cells at the anterior aspect of the lens. these cells appear to separate from the anterior epithelium and undergo a dramatic change that is reminiscent of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (emt). we characterized this phenotype in the par39 strain by examining rates of cell proliferation and by immunostaining for markers of emt. incorporation of the thymidine analog bromodeoxyuridine (brdu) was used to estimate cell proliferation in two functional areas of the lens epithelium: the mitotically active germinative zone (gz) and the less proliferative center zone (cz). staining cell nuclei with diamido 4',6 diamidino 2 phenylindole (dapi) was used to establish a total cell count in the demarcated areas. lens epithelium in par39 transgenic mice demonstrated a decrease in the percentage of brdu/dapi staining within the gz as compared to nontransgenic littermate controls (8.1% vs. 10.9%). a similar decrease in brdu/dapi was observed in the cz (0.6% compared to 3.3%). however, cell density was greater within the gz of par39 mice as compared with nontransgenic controls, while it was not significantly different in the cz among the two groups. furthermore, cells associated with the epithelial plaque did not stain positive for brdu, but were strongly positive for alpha smooth muscle actin, a classical marker for emt. these findings suggest that alr2 over expression is associated with an alteration in the balance between proliferation and apoptosis of epithelial cells in the mouse lens, and that cells associated with epithelial plaques in the par39 lens have features in common with cells undergoing emt.","One of the most prominent areas of research has centered on aldose reductase (ALR2) and its role in the conversion of glucose to sorbitol.

Not only is occasional substance use during adolescence associated with lower social functioning and health problems , but a history of substance use can also result in poorer treatment outcomes among adolescents with SEB .Models with dichotomous outcomes were run using Bernoulli estimation in HLM, which models outcomes with nonlinear, binary distributions. Thus, multilevel linear growth analyses were conducted using Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM 6; ). The same iterative procedure was used in the estimation of all models.Considering that substance use, particularly alcohol use, is known to increase during adolescence through emerging adulthood and then taper off or mature out in young adulthood , the slice of time examined in the current study is thin indeed. Moreover, the effects of family involvement were robust and remained after controlling for demographics and familial factors. In doing so, we examined such relationships across three of the most common substances used by adolescents (alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana), as well as substance use related problems .","Research indicates that children and adolescents with severe emotional and behavioral challenges (SEB) are at greater risk for problematic substance use and receiving a substance use disorder diagnosis (e.g., ).

704,"monoamine oxidase a and b (maoa and maob) appear to be involved in the pathogenesis of major depression, and vulnerability of major depression is associated with personality traits relating to positive and negative affect. this study aimed to investigate associations between maoa and maob polymorphisms and personality traits of positive and negative emotionality in healthy volunteers, to elucidate mechanisms underlying personality and the risk for depression. healthy caucasian volunteers (n = 150) completed the multiphasic personality questionnaire (mpq), which includes independent superfactors of positive emotionality and negative emotionality. participants were genotyped for maoa and maob single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps). association analyses for both snps and haplotypes were performed using the permutation approach implemented in plink. negative emotionality was significantly associated with the two highly linked maob polymorphisms rs10521432 and rs6651806 (p < 0.002). findings were extended in haplotype analyses. for maob the 4 snp haplotype gacg formed from rs1799836, rs10521432, rs6651806 and rs590551 was significantly related to lower negative emotionality scores (p < 0.002). maoa was not related to personality in this study. our finding provides the first evidence that maob polymorphisms influence levels of negative emotionality in healthy human volunteers. if confirmed, these results could lead to a better understanding of personality traits and inter individual susceptibility developing psychiatric disorders such as major depression.","However, it is still unknown how and which MAOA and MAOB variants affect normal variability in emotionality in healthy humans .

705,"summary background the important association between von willebrand factor (vwf) and factor viii (fviii) has been investigated for decades, but the effect of vwf on the reactivity of fviii inhibitory antibodies, referred to as inhibitors, is still controversial. objective to investigate the interaction among vwf, fviii and fviii inhibitory antibodies. methods three sources of inhibitors were used for in vitro studies, including the plasma from immunized vwfnullfviiinull mice, purified plasma igg from human inhibitor patients, or human monoclonal antibody from inhibitor patients b cell clones. inhibitors were incubated with recombinant human fviii (rhfviii) either with or without vwf. the remaining fviii activity was determined by chromogenic assay and inhibitor titers were determined. for in vivo studies, inhibitors and rhfviii were infused into fviiinull or vwfnullfviiinull mice followed by a tail clip survival test. results vwf has a dose dependent protective effect on fviii, limiting inhibitor inactivation of fviii in both mouse and human samples. a preformed complex of vwf with fviii provides more effective protection from inhibitors than competitive binding of antibodies and vwf to fviii. the protective effect of vwf against fviii inactivation by inhibitors was further confirmed in vivo by infusing inhibitors and fviii into fviiinull or vwfnullfviiinull mice followed by a tail clip survival test. conclusion our results demonstrate that vwf exerts a protective effect, reducing inhibitor inactivation of fviii, both in vitro and in vivo.","We hypothesize that the difference in outcome between our studies and those of Gewirtz can be attributed to the different competitive binding interactions among VWF, FVIII and inhibitory antibodies in the two systems . These antibodies can inactivate functional FVIII activity (FVIII:C) and make FVIII replacement therapy ineffective. Factor VIII (FVIII) is a plasma glycoprotein that functions as a cofactor for FIXa in the FX activation complex of the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation .The Vmax of each reaction was converted to units of FVIII:C (U mL1) using the instrument manufacturers software program and the data were averaged . Factor VIII inhibitors: von Willebrand factor makes a difference in vitro and in vivo The levels of FVIII:C were determined by a modified chromogenic assay using the Coatest SP4 FVIII Kit (DiaPharma, Franklin, OH, USA). Both BO2C11 and BOA8D4 bind to the C2 domain of FVIII, while BOIIB2 recognizes the A2a2 region (personal communication with Dr Jacquemin) .To avoid the interference of other plasma proteins that might complicate assessments of the influence of VWF on FVIII:C measurement, we added defined quantities of purified exogenous rhVWF and/or rhFVIII in Coatest buffer in these assays. We believe that this is the appropriate model, as infusion of FVIII followed by a sudden influx of inhibitors has no real clinical parallel . It is well known that VWF forms a non covalently linked complex with FVIII to stabilize and protect it from protease degradation in blood circulation.","We hypothesize that the difference in outcome between our studies and those of Gewirtz can be attributed to the different competitive binding interactions among VWF, FVIII and inhibitory antibodies in the two systems .

706,"pain sometimes has a throbbing, pulsating quality, particularly when it is severe and disabling. we recently challenged the presumption that this throbbing quality is a sensory experience of arterial pulsations, but were unable to offer an alternative explanation for its rhythmic character. here we report a case study of a woman with a history of daily headache consistent with the diagnosis of chronic migraine, but whose throbbing quality persisted long after the resolution of the headache. this chronic, daily, and persistent throbbing sensation, in the absence of headache pain, prompted closer examination for its neurophysiological correlate. by simultaneously recording the subjective report of the throbbing rhythm, arterial pulse, and high density electroencephalogram (eeg), we found that the subjective throbbing rate (48 1.7 bpm) and heart rate (68 bpm) were distinct, in accord with our previous observations that the two are unrelated. on spectral analysis of the eeg we found that the overall amount of activity in the alpha range (8 to hz), or alpha power, increased in association with greater throbbing intensity. in addition, we also found that the rhythmic oscillations of overall alpha power, the so called modulations of alpha power, coincided with the timing of the throbbing rhythm, and that this synchrony, or coherence, was proportional to the subjective intensity of the throbbing quality. this index case will motivate further studies whose aim is to determine whether modulations of alpha power could more generally represent a neurophysiological correlate of the throbbing quality of pain.","Throbbing, pulsatile pain is one such quality that has long been presumed to arise in the periphery, as a sensory experience of arterial pulsations. Accordingly, throbbing pain that is frequently associated with tissue injury and inflammation, such as post surgical pain , bone fracture , cervical artery dissection , giant cell arteritis , and dental pain is often taken as evidence in support of this presumption . Isnard and colleagues recently described another compelling example of a purely central lesion related to throbbing pain in a patient whose episodic sensory seizures were manifested by a throbbing pain sensation, and whose clinical and electrographic abnormalities resolved with the ablation of a focal area of cortical dysplasia within the right posterior insula .The statistical significance of the difference was assessed by paired t test . As was customary for the subject, the throbbing intensity increased markedly as the day progressed. The overall power spectra associated with weak or strong throbbing is the average power spectra from all channels for both recording sessions.Second is the so called mal de debarquement, a chronic illusory perception of a swaying, rocking or bobbing motion triggered by a prolonged exposure to passive rhythmic movement, such as riding on a boat . In the session associated with strong throbbing, the average interval between adjacent throbbing events was 1.25 +/ 0.05 sec, which is close to the average interval between adjacent peaks in the rhythmic modulations of alpha power (1.20 +/ 0.49 sec), whereas in the session associated with the weak experience of throbbing, the average interval between adjacent throbbing events was 1.44 +/0.11 sec, which is larger compared to the average interval between adjacent alpha power peaks of 1.18 + / 0.45 sec . However, extensive radiographic studies failed to find a vascular etiology, and in the present case there was no correspondence to arterial pulse.","Throbbing, pulsatile pain is one such quality that has long been presumed to arise in the periphery, as a sensory experience of arterial pulsations.

708,"nicotine withdrawal is associated with subtle working memory deficits that predict subsequent relapse. we examined the neural substrates underlying these processes in treatment seeking smokers, and explored the moderating influence of age on abstinence induced alterations in brain activity and performance. sixty three smokers participated in two blood oxygen level dependent (bold) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) scans while performing a visual n back task on two separate occasions: smoking as usual and after hours of biochemically confirmed abstinence (order counterbalanced). abstinence (versus smoking) led to reduced accuracy, slower median correct response time, and reduced bold signal change in the a priori regions of interest (rois): medial frontal/cingulate gyrus and right and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. significant age x session effects were found for bold signal change in all three regions, as well as for withdrawal and craving; for all measures, abstinence effects were attenuated in smokers aged >50 years compared to those < years old. these results suggest that abstinence effects on neurocognitive function may be more pronounced for younger smokers, and may indicate a new avenue for research exploring mechanisms underlying age differences in smoking cessation success.","However, there is some debate over the direction and interpretation of these changes in BOLD signal. Of relevance to nicotine dependence, working memory facilitates top down executive control and behavioral inhibition through active maintenance of task related goals . Moreover, effective smoking cessation medications reverse these deficits in rodent models and in human smokers .abstinence (versus smoking) led to reduced accuracy, slower median correct response time, and reduced bold signal change in the 3 a priori regions of interest (rois): medial frontal/cingulate gyrus and right and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. sixty three smokers participated in two blood oxygen level dependent (bold) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) scans while performing a visual n back task on two separate occasions: smoking as usual and after 24 hours of biochemically confirmed abstinence (order counterbalanced). All subject imaging sessions were acquired on the same scanner (Siemens Tim Trio 3 Tesla, Erlangen, Germany; 32 channel head coil) using the same imaging sequences.Also, because BOLD fMRI measures changes in the relative ratio of oxygenated to deoxygenated hemoglobin, it may be sensitive to nicotine induced changes in global cortical vasodilation . In addition, nicotine withdrawal alters dopaminergic tone ; thus, age associated declines in dopamine D1 and D2 receptors and the dopamine transporter may attenuate withdrawal effects on dopamine transmission.

709,"since stimulant use disorders (suds) remain prevalent across the lifespan, cognition is an important area of clinical care and research focus among aging adults with suds. this secondary analysis of a national institute on drug abuse clinical trials network study suggests that decision making, verbal learning/memory, executive function and set shifting are important cognitive domains to screen clinically and treat in aging adults with suds. some suggestions are made on how clinical treatment providers can practically use these results. an important direction for future research is the development of cognitively remediating treatments for impaired cognitive domains in aging adults with suds.","Exploring this relationship can help theoretically understand how the aging process, in the context of concurrent SUDs, affects the underlying brain regions responsible for complex cognitive domains like impulsivity and decision making (e.g., orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex), . Thus, the aim of this secondary analysis was to assess the association of age on baseline measures of impulsivity and decision making, among other neurocognitive measures. However, there is even more limited research on the relationship between age and impulsivity and between age and decision making in SUDs.The Spearmans rho, a non parametric test, assessed correlation between age and each neurocognitive measure. We controlled for sex, as hormonal factors may mediate sex differences in impulsivity. All analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.3 (Cary, NC) .Thus, our hypotheses were partially supported . However, since no neuroimaging was conducted in this study, it is hard to speculate too much about what underlying neural correlates explain the results.

710,"by combining isoelectric focusing (ief) with subsequent gel electrophoresis, two dimensional electrophoresis (2de) affords more specific characterization of proteins than each constituent unit separation. in a new approach to integrating the two assay dimensions in a microscope slide sized glass device, we introduce microfluidic 2de using photopatterned polyacrylamide (pa) gel elements housed in a millimeter scale, micron deep chamber. the microchamber minimizes information loss inherent to channel network architectures commonly used for microfluidic 2de. to define the ief axis along a lane at the top of the chamber, we used free solution carrier ampholytes and immobilized acrylamido buffers in the pa gels. this approach yielded high resolution (0.1 ph units) and rapid (<20 min) ief. next, protein transfer to the second dimension was accomplished using chemical mobilization perpendicular to the ief axis. mobilization drove focused proteins off the ief lane and into a region for protein gel electrophoresis. using fluorescently labeled proteins, we observed transfer induced band broadening factors ~7.5 fold lower than those observed in microchannel networks. both native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (page) and pore limit electrophoresis (ple) were studied as the second assay dimension and completed in <15 min. ple yields protein molecular mass information without the need for ionic surfactant or reducing agents, simplifying device design and operation. microchamber based 2de unifies two independent separation dimensions in a single device with minimal transfer associated information losses. peak capacities for the total assay ranged from to with <1 hr assay duration. the rapid microchamber 2de assay has the potential to bridge an existing gap in targeted proteomics for protein biomarker validation and systems biology that may complement recent innovation in mass spectrometry.","The continuous gel elements do not discretize the first stage and minimize transfer losses by harnessing fine microfluidic transport control without valves [ ].

712,"owing to their exceptional properties and versatility, fullerenes are in widespread use for numerous applications. increased production and use of fullerenes will inevitably result in accelerated environmental release. however, study of the occurrence, fate, and transport of fullerenes in the environment is complicated because a variety of surface modifications can occur as a result of either intentional functionalization or natural processes. to gain a better understanding of the effect and risk of fullerenes on environmental health, it is necessary to acquire reliable data on the parent compounds and their congeners. whereas currently established quantification methods generally focus on analysis of unmodified fullerenes, we discuss in this review the occurrence and analysis of oxidized fullerene congeners (i.e., their corresponding epoxides and polyhydroxylated derivatives) in the environment and in biological specimens. we present possible strategies for detection and quantification of parent nanomaterials and their various derivatives.","Among these materials are fullerenes, which are especially attractive owing to the many covalent modifications and coatings that can give the compounds modular properties . Hence, toxicologists and exposure scientists study different types of fullerene dispersion [, , ] and focus mostly on pristine full erenes, polyhydroxylated fullerenes (also known as fullerols or PHFs), or complex fullerene derivatives for specific applications [, , , ], whereas the toxicology of fullerene size (e.g., C60 versus C70) or fullerene particle size is rarely studied . Nonetheless, prudence is advised when interpreting toxicity data on nC60 prepared in a carrier solvent, because transformation of the solvent can lead to unexpected toxic effects independent of the fullerene itself .As already mentioned, one of the distinguishing properties of UV transformed fullerenes is their insolubility in toluene. The second exposure route, inhalation, is the best studied in fullerene nanotoxicology. The fraction of water soluble fullerenes that the body does absorb will probably mostly not be excreted via urine, assuming murine models are a valid means of providing information about uptake, metabolism, and excretion by humans .For a more complete risk assessment of fullerenes, more work will be needed to reveal this currently obscured but putatively substantial fullerene chemistry. This thermal instability may thus be exploited for defunctionalization of fullerol species. Therefore, their actual occurrence and environmental concentrations may be significantly greater than those determined experimentally by use of available methods of limited capacity.","Among these materials are fullerenes, which are especially attractive owing to the many covalent modifications and coatings that can give the compounds modular properties .

719,"gammagard ivig is a therapeutic approach to treat alzheimer's disease currently in phase clinical trials. despite the reported efficacy of the approach the mechanism of action is poorly understood. we have previously shown that intracranial injection of anti a antibodies into the frontal cortex and hippocampus reveals important information regarding the time course of events once the agent is in the brain. in the current study we compared ivig, mouse pooled igg and the anti a antibody 6e10 injected intracranially into the frontal cortex and hippocampus of month old app/ps1 mice. we established a time course of events ranging from day to days post injection. ivig and pooled mouse igg both significantly reduced a deposition to the same degree as the 6e10 anti a antibody, however, the clearance was much slower to occur, happening between the day and day time points. in contrast, as we have previously shown, a reductions were apparent with the 6e10 anti a group at the 1 day time point. also, neuroinflammatory profiles were significantly altered by the antibody treatments. app/ps1 transgenic mice at months of age typically exhibit an m2a inflammatory phenotype. all antibody treatments stimulated an m2b response, yet anti a antibody was a more rapid change. because the neuroinflammatory switch occurs prior to the detectable reductions in amyloid deposition, we hypothesize that the ivig and pooled mouse igg act as immune modulators and this immune modulation is responsible for the reductions in amyloid pathology.","We are using the macrophage phenotypes of M1, M2a, M2b and M2c to characterize the neuroinflammatory phenotype of the brain.

720,"objective the course of binge eating in adolescence is variable and little is known about factors maintaining binge eating behaviors. the current study sought to characterize the course of binge eating and identify psychosocial factors associated with its maintenance. methods a population based sample reported on binge eating, depression symptoms, self esteem, and body satisfaction at 5 year intervals spanning early/middle adolescence [time (t1)], late adolescence/early young adulthood [time (t2)] and early/middle young adulthood [time (t3)]. logistic regression examined factors predicting maintenance or cessation of binge eating. results a total of 15.8% of participants with binge eating at t1 continued to report binge eating at t2, and 42.0% of participants with binge eating at t2 continued to report binge eating at t3. from t1 to t2, improvements in self esteem predicted cessation of binge eating. from t2 to t3, cessation of binge eating was predicted by improved body satisfaction, greater decreases in depression symptoms, and greater improvements in self esteem. conclusions binge eating is relatively stable from late adolescence/early young adulthood to early/middle young adulthood, but less so from middle/late adolescence to late adolescence/early young adulthood. improvements in psychosocial functioning during this timeframe may improve the outcome of binge eating, although mechanisms responsible for psychosocial changes (e.g., treatment involvement) require further investigation. self esteem appears to be a particularly salient factor involved in binge eating cessation and should be targeted in prevention and treatment programs.","Binge eating (overeating while feeling a sense of loss of control; ) is prevalent among youth, and is associated with obesity and psychosocial impairment .

724,"non rigid registration of diffusion mri is crucial for group analyses and building white matter and fiber tract atlases. most current diffusion mri registration techniques are limited to the alignment of diffusion tensor imaging (dti) data. we propose a novel diffeomorphic registration method for high angular resolution diffusion images by mapping their orientation distribution functions (odfs). odfs can be reconstructed using q ball imaging (qbi) techniques and represented by spherical harmonics (shs) to resolve intra voxel fiber crossings. the registration is based on optimizing a diffeomorphic demons cost function. unlike scalar images, deforming odf maps requires odf reorientation to maintain its consistency with the local fiber orientations. our method simultaneously reorients the odfs by computing a wigner rotation matrix at each voxel, and applies it to the sh coefficients during registration. rotation of the coefficients avoids the estimation of principal directions, which has no analytical solution and is time consuming. the proposed method was validated on both simulated and real data sets with various metrics, which include the distance between the estimated and simulated transformation fields, the standard deviation of the general fractional anisotropy and the directional consistency of the deformed and reference images. the registration performance using shs with different maximum orders were compared using these metrics. results show that the diffeomorphic registration improved the affine alignment, and registration using shs with higher order shs further improved the registration accuracy by reducing the shape difference and improving the directional consistency of the registered and reference odf maps.","This leads to a natural representation of the local diffusion using SHs.

725,"objectives pregnancy and lactation involve adaptations in immune regulation, but little is known about cross cultural variation in inflammatory changes during pregnancy or lactation. here we report concentrations of c reactive protein (crp) in a large cross sectional sample of healthy filipino women who vary in parity, gestational and lactational status, and who come from a population previously described as having low crp. methods fasting plasma crp was measured among female participants (ages 20.8 22.4 years) in the cebu longitudinal health and nutrition survey (n=822). results median crp was 0.2 mg/l in nulliparous women and peaked at 2.0 mg/l in women in their 3rd trimester of pregnancy. parous but post partum women had higher crp compared to nulliparous women, which was largely explained by body composition differences as reflected in waist circumference and skinfold measures. among post partum women with infants, crp was similar in women who were currently breastfeeding compared to those who were not. conclusions at cebu, women late in gestation have 10 fold higher c reactive protein compared to nulliparous women, with no evidence that lactation is inflammatory. these population based findings are similar with findings from prior clinic based studies and are consistent with the maternal immunological adaptations initiated during pregnancy. the tendency of human females to spend more time than females of other great apes in gestation rather than lactation suggests that the human life history strategy involved increased time spent by reproductively aged females in a pro inflammatory state.","Consistent with these maternal immunological adaptations, studies of pregnant women consistently report higher levels of pro inflammatory cytokines and related immune factors, such as C reactive protein, although they vary in the pattern of changes documented .

727,"chronic abuse of drugs can result in vast negative repercussions on behavioral and biological systems by altering underlying neurocircuitry. long term cannabinoid administration in rats leads to detrimental cellular and dendritic morphology changes. previous studies have found that chronic treatment with delta 9 thc selectively decreases dendritic morphology and spine density in the dentate gyrus of young rats (rubino et al., 2009), however, whether these changes are specific to a particular developmental age is not known. the present study evaluated the effects of chronic exposure (7 or days) to win 55, 212 2 (i.p., 3.7 mg/kg), a potent cannabinoid agonist, on dendritic morphology of dentate gyrus neurons in adult rats. upon completion of treatment brains were processed for golgi cox staining. no significant effects of win 55, 212 2 exposure were observed for dendritic branching or length. spine density was quantified in the inner (proximal), middle, and outer (distal) thirds of the dendritic fields selected to approximate the spatial loci of afferents comprising the associational commissural pathway, medial perforant path, and lateral perforant path, respectively. compared to vehicle controls there was a significant reduction in spine density (~1 spine/10m) in the inner and middle dendritic segments. the spine density reduction was significant in inner segments following days of treatment. these results suggest that chronic cannabinoid treatment specifically alters spine density in the dendritic targets of the associational commissural afferents and medial perforant path projections, but not lateral perforant path. the resulting loss of dendritic spine density may be an important factor underlying cannabinoid induced memory impairments.","The most commonly reported outcomes of cannabinoid use or exposure are robust short term memory deficits mediated by CB1 receptors in the CA1 region of the hippocampus .

731,"excessive glucocorticoid exposure during chronic stress causes synapse loss and learning impairment. under normal physiological conditions, glucocorticoid activity oscillates in synchrony with the circadian rhythm. whether and how endogenous glucocorticoid oscillations modulate synaptic plasticity and learning is unknown. here we show that circadian glucocorticoid peaks promote postsynaptic dendritic spine formation in the mouse cortex after motor skill learning, whereas troughs are required for stabilizing newly formed spines that are important for long term memory retention. conversely, chronic and excessive exposure to glucocorticoids eliminates learning associated new spines and disrupts previously acquired memories. furthermore, we show that glucocorticoids promote rapid spine formation through a non transcriptional mechanism by means of the lim kinasecofilin pathway and increase spine elimination through transcriptional mechanisms involving mineralocorticoid receptor activation. together, these findings indicate that tightly regulated circadian glucocorticoid oscillations are important for learning dependent synaptic formation and maintenance. they also delineate a new signaling mechanism underlying these effects.","Notably, under normal physiological conditions, glucocorticoid activity oscillates in synchrony with circadian rhythms: diurnal peaks and troughs are closely coupled with the active and inactive phases of the circadian cycle,. Previous studies have shown that prolonged exposure to glucocorticoids causes postsynaptic dendritic spine loss and branch atrophy in diverse cortical and subcortical areas. Classically, these effects were presumed to be mediated by transcriptional mechanisms, which typically act relatively slowly by regulating gene expression.By contrast, corticosterone administered during the circadian peak did not affect spine retention or performance, indicating a specific function of the circadian trough beyond merely reducing cumulative exposure.

732,"background due to concern that mucinous malignant or borderline ovarian neoplasms (mon) may represent metastatic deposits from appendiceal primaries, gynecologic oncologists routinely perform appendectomy in these cases. however, a multidisciplinary critique of this practice is lacking. methods the new england case control study database was utilized to compare the effect of prior appendectomy against known risk factors for mon. pathology and operative reports of local cases of mon were reviewed to estimate the frequency of microscopic mucinous lesions in the appendix. protein expression patterns among mucinous ovarian, colorectal, and appendiceal cancers were compared by immunohistochemistry. results from the new england case control study, cases of mon were compared against 2,339 age matched controls. prior appendectomy did not reduce the risk of mon (or 1.28, 95% ci 0.831.92, p=0.23), while prior tubal ligation, parity, and breastfeeding were each protective against mon. active smoking (or 2.04, 95% ci 1.482.80, p<0.001) was associated with an increased risk of mon. among mucinous adnexal tumors, appendectomy did not reclassify any mon as appendiceal in origin. by immunohistochemistry, mucinous ovarian carcinomas tended to be ck7+/ck20 /muc2 /cdx2 , whereas mucinous colorectal and appendiceal adenocarcinomas were typically ck7 /ck20+/muc2+/cdx2+, although with some overlap in immunophenotype. additionally, pax8 was positive in a subset of moc and negative in all appendiceal carcinomas. conclusion prior appendectomy is not protective against development of malignant or borderline mon. routine appendectomy during surgery for mon seldom reveals an unsuspected gi primary in early stage tumors but may aid in final diagnosis in advanced stage cases.","Indeed, the epidemiology, histology, and molecular biology of MON are routinely compared to GI mucinous carcinomas, in particular those arising in the colon .

734,"summary we present an approach to model the dispersion of fiber and sheet orientations in the myocardium. by utilizing structure parameters, an existing orthotropic and invariant based constitutive model developed to describe the passive behavior of the myocardium is augmented. two dispersion parameters are fitted to experimentally observed angular dispersion data of the myocardial tissue. computations are performed on a unit myocardium tissue cube and on a slice of the left ventricle indicating that the dispersion parameter has an effect on the myocardial deformation and stress development. the use of fiber dispersions relating to a pathological myocardium had a rather big effect. the final example represents an ellipsoidal model of the left ventricle indicating the influence of fiber and sheet dispersions upon contraction over a cardiac cycle. although only a minor shift in the pressurevolume (pv) loops between the cases with no dispersions and with fiber and sheet dispersions for a healthy myocardium was observed, a remarkably different behavior is obtained with a fiber dispersion relating to a diseased myocardium. in future simulations, this dispersion model for myocardial tissue may advantageously be used together with models of, for example, growth and remodeling of various cardiac diseases.","When including the dispersion parameter in a ventricular simulation incorporating electrical activation, the pressurevolume (PV) loop is considerably altered. The LV builds up the necessary pressure by active contraction where the electrical activation of the heart triggers a cascade of events leading to a shortening of the cardiac myocytes. Furthermore, the dispersion of the fibers has been shown to have a circular distribution, they are not located in plane .Therefore, we have focused on the description of the dispersion model and have attempted to show the related mechanisms. The fit of the histogram data to the PDF assumes a bell shaped data distribution. However, this limitation does not affect the qualitative conclusions drawn from using the proposed dispersed formulation for myocardium .During passive inflation of the slice, the first principal stress changes from being elevated in a mid myocardial band for low fiber dispersion to being elevated at the endocardial border for high fiber dispersion. This shift is similar to what is commonly seen when inflating a thick walled tube . This would entail an isotropic contraction, which is, however, impossible without altering the volume.","When including the dispersion parameter in a ventricular simulation incorporating electrical activation, the pressurevolume (PV) loop is considerably altered.

737,"neuroimaging genetics has attracted growing attention and interest, which is thought to be a powerful strategy to examine the influence of genetic variants (i.e., single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps)) on structures or functions of human brain. in recent studies, univariate or multivariate regression analysis methods are typically used to capture the effective associations between genetic variants and quantitative traits (qts) such as brain imaging phenotypes. the identified imaging qts, although associated with certain genetic markers, may not be all disease specific. a useful, but underexplored, scenario could be to discover only those qts associated with both genetic markers and disease status for revealing the chain from genotype to phenotype to symptom. in addition, multimodal brain imaging phenotypes are extracted from different perspectives and imaging markers consistently showing up in multimodalities may provide more insights for mechanistic understanding of diseases (i.e., alzheimers disease (ad)). in this work, we propose a general framework to exploit multi modal brain imaging phenotypes as intermediate traits that bridge genetic risk factors and multi class disease status. we applied our proposed method to explore the relation between the well known ad risk snp apoe rs429358 and three baseline brain imaging modalities (i.e., structural magnetic resonance imaging (mri), fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (fdg pet) and f 18 florbetapir pet scans amyloid imaging (av45)) from the alzheimers disease neuroimaging initiative (adni) database. the empirical results demonstrate that our proposed method not only helps improve the performances of imaging genetic associations, but also discovers robust and consistent regions of interests (rois) across multi modalities to guide the disease induced interpretation.","A valuable scenario would be to discover only those QTs associatedwith both genetic markers and disease status to better reveal the biologicalpathways specific to the disease.

738,"infections caused by streptococcus pneumoniae are a major cause of mortality throughout the world. protein based pneumococcal vaccines are envisaged to replace or complement the current polysaccharide based vaccines. in this context, detoxified pneumolysin (dply) and pneumococcal histidine triad protein d (phtd) are two potential candidates for incorporation into pneumococcal vaccines. in this study, the protective efficacy of a phtd dply vaccine was evaluated in a rhesus macaque (macaca mulatta) model of pneumonia. the animals were immunized twice with g of phd and g of dply formulated in the adjuvant system as02 or with as02 alone, before they were challenged with a 19f pneumococcal strain. the survival was significantly higher in the protein vaccinated group and seemed to be linked to the capacity to greatly reduce bacterial load within the first week post challenge. vaccination elicited high concentrations of anti phtd and anti ply antibodies and a link was found between survival and antibody levels. in conclusion, as02 adjuvanted phtd dply vaccine protects against s. pneumoniae induced pneumonia. it is probable that the protection is at least partially mediated by phtd and ply specific antibodies.","Current vaccines are composed of epidemiologically dominant serotype specific pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides, conjugated or not to a carrier protein .

739,"it has been hypothesized that the medial prefrontal cortex (mpfc) is a hub in the network that mediates appetitive responses whereas the amygdala is thought to mediate both aversive and appetitive processing. both structures may facilitate adaptive responses to emotional challenge by linking perception, attention, memory, and motor circuits. we provide an initial exploration of these hypotheses by recording simultaneous eeg fmri in eleven participants viewing affective pictures. mpfc and amygdala seeded functional connectivity maps were generated by applying the beta series correlation method. the mpfc seeded correlation map encompassed visual regions, sensorimotor areas, prefrontal cortex, and medial temporal lobe structures, exclusively for pleasant content. for the amygdala seeded correlation map, a similar set of distributed brain areas appeared in the unpleasant neutral contrast, with the addition of such subcortical structures as insula and thalamus. a substantially sparser network was recruited for the pleasant neutral contrast. using the late positive potential (lpp) to index the intensity of emotional engagement, functional connectivity was found to be stronger in trials with larger lpp. these results demonstrate that mpfc mediated functional interactions are engaged specifically during appetitive processing, whereas the amygdala is coupled to distinct sets of brain regions during both aversive and appetitive processing. the strength of these interactions varies as a function of the intensity of emotional engagement.","The amygdala and mPFC are thought to form communication hubs within these assemblies , owing to their dense interconnectivity with many regions of the brain supporting perceptual motor processing and behavioral control .

743,"rich collections of genomic and epigenomic annotations, availabilities of large population cohorts for genome wide association studies (gwas), and advancements in data integration techniques provide the unprecedented opportunity to accelerate discoveries in complex disease studies through integrative analyses. in this paper, we apply a variety of approaches to integrate gwas summary statistics of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) with functional annotations to illustrate how data integration could help researchers understand complex human diseases. we show that incorporating functional annotations can better prioritize gwas signals at both the global and the local levels. signal prioritization on severe copd gwas reveals multiple potential risk loci that are linked with pulmonary functions. enrichment analysis provides novel insights on the pathogenesis of copd and hints the existence of genetic contributions to muscle dysfuncion and chronic lung inflammation, two symptoms that are often co morbid with copd. our results suggest that rich signals for copd genetics are still buried under the bonferroni corrected genome wide significance threshold. many more biological findings are expected to emerge as more samples are recruited for copd studies.","Despite its great success, GWAS has several notable limitations.

746,"methods to assess the significance of mediated effects in education and the social sciences are well studied and fall into two categories: single sample methods and computer intensive methods. a popular single sample method to detect the significance of the mediated effect is the test of joint significance, and a popular computer intensive method to detect the significance of the mediated effect is the bias corrected bootstrap method. both these methods are used for testing the significance of mediated effects in structural equation models (sems). a recent study by leth steensen and gallitto provided evidence that the test of joint significance was more powerful than the bias corrected bootstrap method for detecting mediated effects in sems, which is inconsistent with previous research on the topic. the goal of this article was to investigate this surprising result and describe two issues related to testing the significance of mediated effects in sems which explain the inconsistent results regarding the power of the test of joint significance and the bias corrected bootstrap found by leth steensen and gallitto 2015. the first issue was that the bias corrected bootstrap method was conducted incorrectly. the bias corrected bootstrap was used to estimate the standard error of the mediated effect as opposed to creating confidence intervals. the second issue was that the correlation between the path coefficients of the mediated effect was ignored as an important aspect of testing the significance of the mediated effect in sems. the results of the replication study confirmed prior research on testing the significance of mediated effects. that is, the bias corrected bootstrap method was more powerful than the test of joint significance, and the bias corrected bootstrap method had elevated type error rates in some cases. additional methods for testing the significance of mediated effects in sems were considered and limitations and future directions were discussed.","b) and each of their variances (i.e., sa2 and sb2).

750,"autopsy studies of alzheimers disease (ad) have found that neurofibrillary tangle (nft) pathology of the medial temporal lobe (mtl) demonstrates selective topography with relatively stereotyped subregional involvement at early disease stages, prompting interest in more granular measurement of these structures with in vivo mri. we applied a novel, automated method for measurement of hippocampal subfields and extrahippocampal mtl cortical regions. the cohort included cognitively normal (cn) adults (n=86), early mild cognitive impairment (emci; n=43), late mci (lmci; n=22), and mild ad (n=40) patients from the alzheimers disease neuroimaging initiative (adni). for pseudolongitudinal analysis of the continuum from preclinical to mild ad dementia, the groups were further divided according to amyloid status based on pet. specific subregions associated with the early nft pathology of ad were more sensitive to preclinical and early prodromal ad than whole hippocampal volume while more diffuse involvement was found in later stages. in particular, ba35, the first region associated with nft deposition, was the only region to discriminate preclinical ad from amyloid negative cn adults (normal aging). in general, patterns of atrophy in the pseudolongitudinal analysis largely recapitulated braak staging of nfts within the mtl.","Using this method, measurement of select subregions, including CA1 and BA35, have demonstrated greater sensitivity to MCI status than whole hippocampal volumes . While a number of manual protocols for segmentation of the above T2 weighted sequence have been published (; S. G. ; S. G. ; ; ), our group developed an automated technique for labeling hippocampal subfields and cortical MTL regions [(; ; ); see for a different automated approach)]. As such, more global measures of MTL structure may obscure these more specific regional changes at early stages .In addition to examining group statistics, we also calculated absolute percent change in volume and thickness across the spectrum of AD relative to normal aging.

Briefly, after co registration with T1 weighted MRI, an SUVR was calculated by taking the mean uptake over voxels in four regions of interest (ROIs), frontal, anterior/posterior cingulate, lateral parietal, and lateral temporal cortices, and then dividing these regions by mean uptake over voxels of the entire cerebellum.However, the latter does not account for uncertainty in the lateral boundaries or the fact that individuals with the same overall volume may differ along the anterior posterior and medial lateral dimensions.

753,"the present study examined the predictive effects of five impulsivity like traits (premeditation, perseverance, sensation seeking, negative urgency, and positive urgency) on driving outcomes (driving errors, driving lapses, driving violations, cell phone driving, traffic citations, and traffic collisions). with a convenience sample of college student drivers, we found that each of the impulsivity like traits was related to multiple risky driving outcomes. positive urgency (tendency to act impulsively when experiencing negative affect) was the most robust predictor of risky driving outcomes. positive urgency is a relatively newly conceptualized impulsivity like trait that was not examined in the driving literature previously, suggesting a strong need to further examine its role as a personality trait related to risky driving. these findings generally support the multidimensional assessment of impulsivity like traits, and they specifically support the addition of positive urgency to a list of risk factors for risky driving behaviors.","These statistics demonstrate that young drivers are at elevated risk for fatal crashes compared to others. In the present study, we examine how five personality predispositions predict several types of risky driving behaviors and consequences of risky driving among college students: driving violations, driving errors, driving lapses, cell phone driving, traffic citations, and traffic collisions . According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), in 2008, 23% of all traffic fatalities in the United States involved individuals between 16 and 24 years of age .Overall, it appears that individuals who are low in Premeditation are more likely to engage in risky driving, but there is some inconsistency with which Premeditation is related to some driving outcomes like aggressive driving . Thus, a lack of Premeditation was associated with riskier driving prospectively. For example, the group comparison approach with a sample of 100 young male drivers taken by may not have had enough power to detect the relationship between Premeditation and traffic violations .In addition, many researchers in the driving literature use the SSS total score only, which further complicates the separation of Sensation Seeking and Perseverance into distinct impulsivity related traits . Specifically, individuals high in Sensation Seeking were more likely to report they would drive faster on highways, drive faster on wet roads, and drive after consuming alcohol if their vehicle had anti lock brakes. We reasoned that sensation seekers engage in willful driving violations, as they find these behaviors to be enjoyable, whereas those higher in Negative Urgency who have trouble controlling their urges may find themselves engaging in unsafe driving unwittingly.","These statistics demonstrate that young drivers are at elevated risk for fatal crashes compared to others.

754,"transferrins are secreted proteins that bind iron. the well studied transferrins are mammalian serum transferrin, which is involved in iron transport, and mammalian lactoferrin, which functions as an immune protein. lactoferrin and lactoferrin derived peptides have bactericidal activity, and the iron free form of lactoferrin has bacteriostatic activity due to its ability to sequester iron. insect transferrin is similar in sequence to both serum transferrin and lactoferrin, and its functions are not well characterized; however, many studies of insect transferrin indicate that it has some type of immune function. the goal of this study was to determine the specific immune functions of transferrin from manduca sexta (tobacco hornworm). we verified that transferrin expression is upregulated in response to infection in m. sexta larvae and determined that the concentration of transferrin in hemolymph increases from m to m following an immune challenge. it is also present in molting fluid and prepupal midgut fluid, two extracellular fluids with immune capabilities. no immune induced proteolytic cleavage of transferrin in hemolymph was observed; therefore, m. sexta transferrin does not appear to be a source of antimicrobial peptides. unlike iron saturated lactoferrin, iron saturated transferrin had no detectable antibacterial activity. in contrast, m iron free transferrin inhibited bacterial growth, and this inhibition was blocked by supplementing the culture medium with m iron. our results suggest that m. sexta transferrin does not have bactericidal activity, but that it does have a bacteriostatic function that depends on its iron sequestering ability. this study supports the hypothesis that insect transferrin participates in an iron withholding strategy to protect insects from infectious bacteria.","Transferrin is transcriptionally upregulated in response to infection in many species of insects, including representatives from Diptera, Coleoptera, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, and Lepidoptera .

756,"a recently developed membrane mimetic system called styrene maleic acid lipid particles (smalps) or lipodisq nanoparticles has shown to possess significant potential for biophysical studies of membrane proteins. this new nanoparticle system is composed of lipids encircled by sma copolymers. previous studies showed that sma copolymers are capable of extracting membrane proteins directly from their native environments without the assistance of detergents. however, a full structural characterization of this promising membrane mimetic system is still lacking. in this study, the formation of lipodisq nanoparticles was characterized upon addition of the membrane protein kcne1. initially, multi lamellar vesicles (mlvs) containing kcne1 (kcne1 mlvs) at a lipid to protein molar ratio of 500/1 were prepared using a standard dialysis method. sma copolymers were then added to kcne1 mlvs at a series of lipid to sma weight ratios to observe the solubilizing property of sma in the presence of the kcne1 membrane protein. the solubilizing process of kcne1 mlvs by sma copolymers undergoes a transition phase at low sma concentrations (samples with weight ratios of 1/0.25, 1/0.5, and 1/0.75). more lipodisq nanoparticles were formed at higher sma concentrations (samples with weight ratios of 1/1, 1/1.25, and 1/1.5) were directly observed in the corresponding tem images. a single sharp dls peak was observed from the sample at the weight ratio of 1/1.5, which indicated the complete solubilization of kcne1 mlvs. interestingly, the critical weight ratio for empty mlvs was found to be 1/1.25 previously, which suggested that the presence of kcne1 makes it more difficult for the solubilizing process of the sma copolymers. also, a tem image of the 1/1.5 sample showed the presence of silky aggregates of excess copolymers. overall, this study demonstrated the ability of sma copolymers to form lipodisq nanoparticles in the presence of the membrane protein kcne1.","Past structural studies on membrane proteins have relied on the use of these membrane mimetics and tremendous progress has been achieved.

761,"pramipexole and ropinirole are dopamine agonists that are efficacious in treating motor disturbances of neuropathologies, e.g., parkinsons disease and restless legs syndrome. a significant portion of treated patients develop impulsive/compulsive behaviors. current treatment is dose reduction or switching to an alternative dopamine replacement, both of which can undermine the motor benefits. needed is a preclinical model that can assist in identifying adjunct treatments to dopamine agonist therapy that reduce impulsive/compulsive behaviors without interfering with motor benefits of the dopamine agonist. towards that objective, the current study implemented a rat model of parkinsons disease to behaviorally profile chronically administered pramipexole. this was accomplished with male sprague dawley rats wherein (i) 6 hydroxydopamine induced lesions of the dorsolateral striatum produced parkinsons disease like akinesia, measured in the forelimbs, (ii) intracranial self stimulationmediated probability discounting indicated impulsivity/risk taking, and (iii) two doses of pramipexole were continuously administered for days via osmotic minipumps to mirror the chronic, stable exposure achieved with extended release formulations. the atypical antidepressant, mirtazapine, is known to reduce behaviors associated with drug addiction in rats, thus, we demonstrated model utility here by determining the effects of mirtazapine, on pramipexole induced motor improvements versus probability discounting. we observed that forelimb akinesia subsequent to striatal lesions was attenuated by both pramipexole doses tested (0.3 and 1.2mg/kg/day) within 4hr of pump implant dispensing 0.3mg/kg/day and 1h by 1.2mg/kg/day. by contrast, days of infusion with 0.3mg/kg/day did not alter discounting, but increases were obtained with 1.2mg/kg/day pramipexole, with 67% of 1.2mg/kg/day treated rats meeting categorical criteria for high risk taking. insertion of a second minipump delivering mirtazapine did not alter motor function during days of co administration with pramipexole, but was sufficient to attenuate risk taking. these outcomes revealed distinct probability discounting and anti akinesia profiles for pramipexole, indicating that pharmacotherapy, (e.g., mirtazapine treatments), can be developed that reduce risk taking while leaving motor benefits intact.","The hypotheses for the study were that This latter feature likely reflects the lack of mirtazapine binding to dopaminergic receptors .

765,"bilingualism represents an interesting model of possible experience dependent alterations in brain structure. the current study examines whether interhemispheric adaptations in brain structure are associated with bilingualism. corpus callosum volume and cortical thickness asymmetry across regions of interest (selected to include critical language and bilingual cognitive control areas) were measured in a sample of spanish english bilinguals and age and gender matched monolingual individuals (n = per group). cortical thickness asymmetry of the anterior cingulate region differed across groups, with thicker right than left cortex for bilinguals and the reverse for monolinguals. in addition, two adjacent regions of the corpus callosum (mid anterior and central) had greater volume in bilinguals. the findings suggest that structural indices of interhemispheric organization in a critical cognitive control region are sensitive to variations in language experience.","Such functional data raise the question about whether adaptations in brain structure accompany bilingualism.

766,"there is mounting evidence that constraints from action can influence the early stages of object selection, even in the absence of any explicit preparation for action. here, we examined whether action properties of images can influence visual search, and whether such effects were modulated by hand preference. observers searched for an oddball target among three distractors. the search arrays consisted either of images of graspable handles (action related stimuli), or images that were otherwise identical to the handles but in which the semicircular fulcrum element was re oriented so that the stimuli no longer looked like graspable objects (non action related stimuli). in experiment 1, right handed observers, who have been shown previously to prefer to use the right hand over the left for manual tasks, were faster to detect targets in action related versus non action related arrays, and showed a response time (rt) advantage for rightward versus leftward oriented action related handles. in experiment 2, left handed observers, who have been shown to use the left and right hands relatively equally in manual tasks, were also faster to detect targets in the action related versus non action related arrays, but rts were equally fast for rightward and leftward oriented handle targets. together, or results suggest that action properties in images, and constraints for action imposed by preferences for manual interaction with objects, can influence attentional selection in the context of visual search.","Whether or not similar effects of action properties on visual search are observed in neurologically healthy observers is currently unknown .

767,"reduction of salivary nitrate to nitrite by oral microbes expressing nitrate reductase has emerged as a crucial pathway in systemic no homeostasis in humans and other mammals. selective depletion of oral microbes prevents dietary nitrate dependent lowering of blood pressure, inhibition of platelet aggregation and ischemic injury. to date, most studies interrogate enterosalivary nitrate reduction by following changes in saliva or plasma nitrite and no signaling (functional) end points. little is known about whether, and if so how, nitrate reductase enzymatic activity per se (i.e. independent of nitrate levels) is a variable and may account for any individual to individual variation. here, we describe a minimally invasive protocol that allows for nr activity determination from human, rat and mouse tongue scrapes/swabs. we validate this method using selective application of antiseptic agents to the distal tongue surface which decreased nr activity by >80% and show that bacterial number is a significant variable in measured nr activities between males and females. also, we show that nr activity is >80% lower in smokers (humans) and after bromine gas exposure (mice), suggesting that exposure to inhaled reactive substances inhibit nr activity identifying a potentially new mechanism by which environmental toxicants promote dysfunction in no bioavailability. the described method will facilitate studies testing whether nr specific activity is a variable in different pathophysiologic settings, and in turn how this activity modulates enterosalivary nitrate reduction.","We show that under normal conditions, NR activity may vary from individual to individual, but this effect is mediated by varying amounts of bacteria collected in tongue scrapes. Most importantly, these effects are abrogated with prior depletion of the oral microbiome using antiseptic mouthwash . To date, the majority of measures used to follow enterosalivary nitrate reduction are changes in saliva and plasma nitrite levels after nitrate administration, together with functional end points (e.g. blood pressure, exercise performance or platelet aggregation).Brain heart infusion (BHI) broth and tryptic soy blood agar (TSBA) was purchased from anaerobes systems (Morgan Hill, CA). Significance was set at p<0.05 .

775,"many prepubertal girls and young women suffer from premature ovarian insufficiency induced by chemotherapy given for treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases. auto transplantation of cryopreserved ovarian tissue could restore the lost ovarian endocrine function and fertility. unfortunately, tissue ischemia, inconsistent graft quality and the risk of re introducing malignant cells may stand in the way of the clinical translation of this approach. to address these risks and limitations, we engineered an artificial ovary from immature follicles using a synthetic hydrogel, poly(ethylene glycol) vinyl sulfone (peg vs), as a supportive matrix. enzymatically isolated follicles from 7 day old mice ovaries were encapsulated in 7% peg vs hydrogels modified with 0.5mm rgd and crosslinked with a tri functional matrix metalloproteinase (mmp) sensitive peptide. peg hydrogels with the encapsulated follicles were orthotopically implanted into ovariectomized mice to investigate if peg hydrogel supports folliculogenesis and steroidogenesis in vivo. after days, grafts revealed multiple fully developed antral follicles and corpora lutea, which corresponded with regular ovulation cycles and follicle stimulating hormone (fsh) levels. the elevated levels of fsh, caused by bilateral ovariectomy, were reversed by the implanted follicles and maintained at physiological levels for days. importantly, primordial and primary follicles still represented 60% of the follicular pool, demonstrating selective recruitment of primordial follicles into the growing pool. functioning blood vessels in the grafts and days after implantation proved the capability of peg hydrogels to undergo graft remodeling and revascularization. our results demonstrate that peg hydrogels with encapsulated immature ovarian follicles successfully functioned as an artificial ovarian tissue for days in vivo.","A successful transplantation would require significant primordial follicle population, which can contribute to monthly cycles and provide healthy, fertilizable eggs(, ).

778,"we evaluate the impact of carbamylation of the primary amines of the side chains of lys and the n termini on the fragmentation of intact protein ions and the chromatographic properties of a mixture of e. coli ribosomal proteins. the fragmentation patterns of the six unmodified and carbamylated proteins obtained by higher energy collision dissociation (hcd) and ultraviolet photodissociation (uvpd) were compared. carbamylation significantly reduced the total number of protons retained by the protein owing to the conversion of basic primary amines to non basic carbamates. carbamylation caused a significant negative impact on fragmentation of the protein by hcd (i.e., reduced sequence coverage and fewer diagnostic fragment ions) consistent with the mobile proton model, which correlates peptide fragmentation with charge distribution and the opportunity for charge directed pathways. in addition, fragmentation was enhanced near the n and c termini upon hcd of carbamylated proteins. for lcms/ms analysis of e. coli ribosomal proteins, the retention times increased by min on average upon carbamylation, an outcome attributed to the increased hydrophobicity of the proteins after carbamylation. as noted for both the six model proteins and the ribosomal proteins, carbamylation had relatively little impact on the distribution or types of fragment ions product by uvpd, supporting the proposition that the mechanism of uvpd for intact proteins does not reflect the mobile proton model.","The absorption of high energy photons (typically 6.4 eV per 193 nm photon) results in extensive backbone cleavages that result in formation of a, b, c, x, y, and z ions. The irregular distribution of basic residues in proteins may give rise to these uncommon cleavage pathways. Not only does this reduce the average charge state adopted by a given protein upon electrospray ionization, it removes sites of proton sequestration, which alters proton mobility.In essence, carbamylation proceeded with near 100% efficiency. The retention time changes by over 36 min upon carbamylation, thus reflecting the increase in hydrophobicity after modification of the 16 Lys and N terminus of this 11.2 kDa (103 residues) protein. Carbamylation not only causes a significant change in the charge states of proteins and their fragmentation patterns but also alters the chromatographic properties of proteins.Since fragmentation near the termini is dominant upon collisional activation of intact proteins, proteins were selected with Lys near the N terminus (ubiquitin, cytochrome c, lysozyme, superoxide dismutase) or near the C terminus (cytochrome c, superoxide dismutase, carbonic anhydrase) or with Arg in those segments.

780,"while horseshoe crabs limulus polyphemus from regions with two daily tides express endogenous circatidal (~ 12.4 h) activity rhythms, much less is known about locomotor rhythm expression in horseshoe crabs from other tidal regimes. this study investigated whether horseshoe crabs (1) always express activity rhythms consistent with their natural tides, and (2) can alter activity rhythm expression in response to novel tide cycles. activity rhythms of animals from environments with two daily tides (gulf of maine, n/7052 w, and massachusetts, n/7040w), one dominant daily tide (apalachee bay, florida, n/8420 w), and microtides (indian river lagoon, florida, n/8035 w) were recorded in during three artificial tide conditions: no tides, a 12.4 h tidal cycle, and a 24.8 h tidal cycle. interestingly, l. polyphemus from the microtidal site (n = 7) appeared plastic in their responses; they were able to express both bimodal and unimodal rhythms in response to different tide cycles. in contrast, the other two populations exhibited more fixed responses: regardless of the tides they were exposed to, animals from areas with one dominant daily tide (n = 18) consistently expressed unimodal rhythms, while those from areas with two daily tides (n = 28) generally expressed bimodal rhythms. rhythms expressed by l. polyphemus thus appear to be a function of endogenous clocks, the tidal cues to which animals are exposed, and tidal cues that animals experience throughout ontogeny.","Whereas the GM and MA populations experience two daily tides, the GF population experiences either one dominant daily tide , or strictly diurnal tides (one tide every 24.8 h).

784,"background no prospective study of maternal alcohol use has focused on age at transition to motherhood as a predictor of trajectories of risky drinking. the goal of this study was to examine the impact of maternal age at first birth on trajectories of alcohol use beyond recommended levels over a 17 year span. methods pregnant women (n = 456) were recruited at an urban prenatal clinic. the women (1342 years old; 64% african american, 36% white) were interviewed about alcohol use during pregnancy and at 6, 10, 14, and years postpartum. growth mixture modeling (gmm) was used to identify trajectories of risky drinking. maternal age at first birth was then regressed onto trajectory class membership. results the gmm on maternal alcohol use identified groups of mothers as a function of alcohol use before, during and after the pregnancy. the majority of mothers (66%) were identified as having low risk trajectories of alcohol use over the 17 year span. however, two groups were in the higher risk categories, with 23% identified as being in a long term high risk trajectory, and 11% in a short term high risk trajectory group. maternal age at first birth predicted membership in a high risk group: younger mothers were more likely to be classified into a long term high risk alcohol use group. conclusions younger mothers were more likely to engage in risky drinking early in pregnancy, continuing to years postpartum. these results can help physicians target mothers who are likely to exceed current niaaa guidelines of abstinence during pregnancy, and no more than drinks per week in the postpartum.","In this study, age at first birth also predicted frequency of alcohol use .

787,"dye loaded lipid nano droplets present an attractive alternative to inorganic nanoparticles, as they are composed of non toxic biodegradable materials and easy to prepare. however, to achieve high fluorescence brightness, the nano droplets have to be heavily loaded with the dyes avoiding fluorescence self quenching and release (leakage) of the encapsulated dyes from the nano droplets in biological media. in the present work, we have designed highly lipophilic fluorescent derivatives of 3 alkoxyflavone (f888) and nile red (nr668) that can be encapsulated in the lipophilic core of stable nano emulsion droplets at exceptionally high concentrations in the oil core, i.e. up to mm and mm, respectively, corresponding to ~ and dyes per 40 nm droplet. despite this high loading, these dyes keep high fluorescence quantum yield and thus, provide high nano droplet brightness, probably due to their bulky structure preventing self quenching. moreover, simultaneous encapsulation of both dyes at high concentrations in single nano droplets allows observation of fret. fret and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (fcs) studies showed that nr668 release in the serum containing medium is very slow, while the reference hydrophobic dye nile red leaks immediately. this drastic difference in the leakage profile between nr668 and nile red was confirmed by in vitro cellular studies as well as by in vivo angiography imaging on zebrafish model, where the nr668 loaded nano droplets remained in the blood circulation, while the parent nile red leaked rapidly from the droplets distributing all over the animal body. this study suggests new molecular design strategies for obtaining bright nano droplets without dye leakage and their use as efficient and stable optical contrast agents in vitro and in vivo.","Finally, a clearly different leakage profiles for the new and the reference dyes were observed when the nano droplets were added to living cells in culture or injected into zebra fish.

788,"summary host associated microbial communities are influenced by both host genetics and environmental factors. however, factors controlling the human oral microbiome and their impact on disease remain to be investigated. to determine the combined and relative effects of host genotype and environment on oral microbiome composition and caries phenotypes, we profiled the supragingival plaque microbiome of dizygotic and monozygotic twins aged five to eleven. oral microbiome similarity always increased with shared host genotype, regardless of caries state. additionally, although most of the variation in the oral microbiome was determined by environmental factors, highly heritable oral taxa were identified. the most heritable oral bacteria were not associated with caries state, did not tend to co occur with other taxa, and decreased in abundance with age and sugar consumption frequency. thus, while the human oral microbiome composition is influenced by host genetic background, potentially cariogenic taxa are likely not controlled by genetic factors.","For example, just as in the gut, oral microbial communities seem to be initially influenced by perinatal factors (Holgerson et al., 2013; Lif Holgerson et al., 2011, ). Nonetheless, the available evidence on the forces shaping the oral microbiome is scarce. As such, we characterized the microbiome in supragingival plaque (biofilm) swabs of monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs, including children both with and without dental caries.Lastly, no differences were observed in terms of alpha diversity between diseased and healthy twins, regardless of zygosity or tooth surface . i) Only OTUs present in > 50% individuals were taken into account leaving 91 total OTUs; and Some of these taxa also covaried with the frequency of sugar consumption .Moreover, the realization that there remain wild type protective taxa that may be lost with time and environmental influences, offers clues for developing potential prevention or treatment strategies based on microbial agents. Likewise, due to the significant age driven variation in heritability estimates among oral taxa, analyses expanded across longitudinal scales with the same individuals are needed.

791,"huntington's disease (hd) is a neurodegenerative disorder involving progressive motor disturbances, cognitive decline, and desynchronized sleepwake rhythms. recent studies revealed that restoring normal sleepwake cycles can improve cognitive function in hd mice, suggesting that some sleep/wake systems remain operational and thus represent potential therapeutic targets for hd. hypothalamic neurons expressing orexins/hypocretins (orexin neurons) are fundamental orchestrators of arousal in mammals, but it is unclear whether orexin circuits operate normally in hd. here we analyzed the electrophysiology, histology, and gene expression of orexin circuits in brain slices from r6/2 mice, a transgenic model of hd with a progressive neurological phenotype. we report that in r6/2 mice, the size of an electrically distinct subpopulation of orexin neurons is reduced, as is the number of orexin immunopositive cells in some hypothalamic regions. r6/2 orexin cells display altered glutamatergic inputs, and have an abnormal circadian profile of activity, despite normal circadian rhythmicity of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (scn), the master clock of the brain. nevertheless, even at advanced stages of hd, intrinsic firing properties of orexin cells remain normal and suppressible by serotonin, noradrenaline, and glucose. furthermore, histaminergic neurons (key cells required for the propagation of orexin induced arousal) also display normal responses to orexin. together, these data suggest that the orexin system remains functional and modifiable in hd mice, although its circadian activity profile is disrupted and no longer follows that of the scn.","The exact function of huntingtin is unclear, although it has been implicated in many aspects of cellular function, including vesicle trafficking, axonal transport, signaling, transcriptional regulation, and mitochondrial dynamics (; ; ). Orexins/hypocretins are neurotransmitters made by a small group of hypothalamic neurons . Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion mutation in the HTT gene causing a polyglutamine repeat expansion in the huntingtin protein .We compared the intrinsic electrical properties of living orexin neurons (identified by targeted eGFP expression, see ) from age and litter matched wild type (WT) mice and R6/2 mice in advanced stages of their disease (>14 week old mice).

793,"key aspects of native endochondral bone development and fracture healing can be mimicked in mesenchymal stem cells (mscs) through standard in vitro chondrogenic induction. exploiting this phenomenon has recently emerged as an attractive technique to engineer bone tissue, however relatively little is known about the best conditions for doing so. the objective of this study was to compare the bone forming capacity and angiogenic induction of hypertrophic cell constructs containing human adipose derived stem cells (hascs) primed for chondrogenesis in two different culture systems: high density pellets and alginate bead hydrogels. hasc constructs were subjected to weeks of identical chondrogenic induction in vitro, encapsulated in an agarose carrier, and then implanted subcutaneously in immune compromised mice for weeks to evaluate their endochondral potential. at the time of implantation, both pellets and beads expressed aggrecan and type ii collagen, as well as alkaline phosphatase (alp) and type x collagen. interestingly, ascs in pellets formed a matrix containing higher glycosaminoglycan and collagen content than that in beads, and alp activity per cell was higher in pellets. however, after weeks in vivo, pellets and beads induced an equivalent volume of mineralized tissue and a comparable level of vascularization. although osteocalcin and osteopontin positive osteogenic tissue and new vascular growth was found within both types of constructs, all appeared to be better distributed throughout the hydrogel beads. the results of this ectopic model indicate that hydrogel culture may be an attractive alternative to cell pellets for bone tissue engineering via the endochondral pathway.","Biochemical stimulation is only one of two factors critical for successful chondrogenesis in vitro. Preliminary studies comparing the chondrogenic potential of stem cells derived from adipose tissue and bone marrow reported that ASCs were inferior to their bone marrow derived stem cell (BMSC) counterparts (; ; ). ASCs are an attractive alternative as a therapeutic cell source because they are readily accessible, safe to harvest, and available in larger quantities than bone marrow aspirate .Alternatively, cell pellets were collected and rinsed with sterile PBS. Hydrolysates were dissolved in deionized water with a sarcosine internal standard and subjected to a derivitization process . Immunohistochemistry confirmed the quantitative biochemical analyses and revealed the spatial distribution of chondrogenic markers type II collagen (Col II) and aggrecan (AGC; ).Thus, hydrogel culture may be a more relevant means of translating these experimental methods to clinical applications in the future . Pellets lost approximately 60 % of their DNA content over the culture period, though there was no evidence of necrosis in the central region of the aggregate.

799,"in calcified tissues such as bones and teeth, mineralization is regulated by an extracellular matrix, which includes non collagenous proteins (ncp). this natural process has been adapted or mimicked to restore tissues following physical damage or demineralization by using polyanionic acids in place of ncps, but the remineralized tissues fail to fully recover their mechanical properties. here we show that pre treatment with certain amphiphilic peptoids, a class of peptide like polymers consisting of n substituted glycines that have defined monomer sequences, enhances ordering and mineralization of collagen and induces functional remineralization of dentin lesions in vitro. in the vicinity of dentin tubules, the newly formed apatite nano crystals are co aligned with the c axis parallel to the tubular periphery and recovery of tissue ultrastructure is accompanied by development of high mechanical strength. the observed effects are highly sequence dependent with alternating polar and non polar groups leading to positive outcomes while diblock sequences have no effect. the observations suggest aromatic groups interact with the collagen while the hydrophilic side chains bind the mineralizing constituents and highlight the potential of synthetic sequence defined biomimetic polymers to serve as ncp mimics in tissue remineralization.","When remineralization is attempted, the absence of NCPs inhibits the development of intrafibrillar HAP. As caries penetrate the outer enamel, which contains little or no organic matrix, it begins to demineralize the underlying dentin, which consists of hydroxyapatite (HAP) nanocrystals located within collagen fibrils (intrafibrillar) and between collagen fibrils (extrafibrillar). One of the salient features of biomineralization is that soluble proteins act in concert with an insoluble macromolecular scaffold to guide mineral formation.The specimen was then carefully polished down to reveal the target depth in such way that the tubule orientation was perpendicular to the polished surface so that the indentation values would be least affected by underlying intertubular dentin. Contact mode AFM in dry condition was used to capture images in 3 randomly selected areas (100 100 m) of the specimens mineralized both with and without peptoid. Solutions were prepared from reagent grade calcium chloride dihydrate (CaCl2H2O), and potassium phosphate di basic (K2HPO4) dissolved in Tris buffered saline (TBS, pH=7.4) and filtered to remove insoluble chemicals.. Longer peptoid pre incubation promoted greater regrowth of peritubular dentin (See ).

805,"rna binding proteins (rbps) play key roles in rna dynamics, including subcellular localization, translational efficiency and metabolism. cold inducible rna binding protein (cirp) is a stress induced protein that was initially described as a dna damage induced transcript (a18 hnrnp), as well as a cold shock domain containing cold stress response protein (cirbp) that alters the translational efficiency of its target messenger rnas (mrnas). this review summarizes recent work on the roles of cirp in the context of inflammation and cancer. the function of cirp in cancer appeared to be solely driven though its functions as an rbp that targeted cancer associated mrnas, but it is increasingly clear that cirp also modulates inflammation. several recent studies highlight roles for cirp in immune responses, ranging from sepsis to wound healing and tumor promoting inflammation. while modulating inflammation is an established role for rbps that target cytokine mrnas, cirp appears to modulate inflammation by several different mechanisms. cirp has been found in serum, where it binds the tlr4 md2 complex, acting as a damage associated molecular pattern (damp). cirp activates the nf b pathway, increasing phosphorylation of i and ib, and stabilizes mrnas encoding pro inflammatory cytokines. while cirp promotes higher levels of pro inflammatory cytokines in certain cancers, it also decreases inflammation to accelerate wound healing. this dichotomy suggests that the influence of cirp on inflammation is context dependent and highlights the importance of detailing the mechanisms by which cirp modulates inflammation.","Recent studies have implicated CIRP in human disease, including several types of cancer, as well as a modulator of inflammation (; ; ; ; ; ; ; ).

807,"background inhibitory control deficits are common in autism spectrum disorder (asd) and associated with more severe repetitive behaviors. inhibitory control deficits may reflect slower execution of stopping processes, or a reduced ability to delay the onset of behavioral responses in contexts of uncertainty. previous studies have documented relatively spared stopping processes in asd, but whether inhibitory control deficits in asd reflect failures to delay response onset has not been systematically assessed. further, while improvements in stopping abilities and response slowing are seen through adolescence/early adulthood in health, their development in asd is less clear. methods a stop signal test (sst) was administered to individuals with asd and age and iq matched healthy controls (ages 528). this test included go trials in which participants pressed a button when a peripheral target appeared and interleaved stop trials in which they were cued to inhibit button presses when a stop signal appeared at variable times following the go cue. stop trial accuracy, rt of the stopping process (ssrt), and reaction time (rt) slowing during go trials were examined. results relative to controls, individuals with asd had reduced accuracy on stop trials. ssrts were similar across control and asd participants, but rt slowing was reduced in patients compared to controls. age related increases in stopping ability and rt slowing were attenuated in asd. reduced stopping accuracy and rt slowing were associated with more severe repetitive behaviors in asd. discussion our findings show that inhibitory control deficits in asd involve failures to strategically delay behavioral response onset. these results suggest that reduced preparatory behavioral control may underpin inhibitory control deficits as well as repetitive behaviors in asd. typical age related improvements in inhibitory control during late childhood/early adolescence are reduced in asd, highlighting an important developmental window during which treatments may mitigate cognitive alterations contributing to repetitive behaviors.","Deficits of inhibitory control are common in autism spectrum disorder (ASD; ) and emerge as early as 24 months old .

811,"glioblastoma (gbm) tumors exhibit potentially actionable genetic alterations against which targeted therapies have been effective in treatment of other cancers. however, these therapies have largely failed in gbm patients. a notable example is egfr kinase inhibitors, which display poor clinical efficacy despite overexpression and/or mutation of egfr in >50% of gbm. in addressing this issue, preclinical models may be limited by the inability to accurately replicate pathophysiological interactions of gbm cells with unique aspects of the brain extracellular matrix (ecm), which is relatively enriched in hyaluronic acid (ha) and flexible. in this study, we present a brain mimetic biomaterial ecm platform for 3d culturing of patient derived gbm cells, with improved pathophysiological properties as an experimental model. compared to orthotopic xenograft assays, the novel biomaterial cultures we developed better preserved the physiology and kinetics of acquired resistance to the egfr inhibition than gliomasphere cultures. orthogonal modulation of both ha content and mechanical properties of biomaterial scaffolds was required to achieve this result. overall, our findings show how specific interactions between gbm cell receptors and scaffold components contribute significantly to resistance to the cytotoxic effects of egfr inhibition.","We contend that the unique brain microenvironment substantially contributes to the failure of targeted EGFR therapies in GBM.

813,"tractography is a powerful technique capable of non invasively reconstructing the structural connections in the brain using diffusion mri images, but the validation of tractograms is challenging due to lack of ground truth. owing to recent developments in mapping the mouse brain connectome, high resolution tracer injection based axonal projection maps have been created and quickly adopted for the validation of tractography. previous studies using tracer injections mainly focused on investigating the match in projections and optimal tractography protocols. being a complicated technique however, tractography relies on multiple stages of operations and parameters. these factors introduce large variabilities in tractograms, hindering the optimization of protocols and making the interpretation of results difficult. based on this observation, in contrast to previous studies, in this work we focused on quantifying and ranking the amount of performance variation introduced by these factors. for this purpose, we performed over a million tractography experiments and studied the variability across different subjects, injections, anatomical constraints and tractography parameters. by using n way anova analysis we show that all tractography parameters are significant and importantly performance variations with respect to the differences in subjects is comparable to the variations due to tractography parameters, which strongly underlines the importance of fully documenting the tractography protocols in scientific experiments. we also quantitatively show that inclusion of anatomical constraints is the most significant factor for improving tractography performance. although this critical factor helps reduce false positives, our analysis indicates that anatomy informed tractography still fails to capture a large portion of axonal projections.","In spite of the developments in dMRI and tractography techniques, we still face the long standing challenge of missing ground truth for the validation of connections reconstructed by tractography.

818,"schizophrenia is associated with heterogeneous clinical symptoms and neuroanatomical alterations. in this work, we aim to disentangle the patterns of neuroanatomical alterations underlying a heterogeneous population of patients using a semi supervised clustering method. we apply this strategy to a cohort of patients with schizophrenia of varying extends of disease duration, and we describe the neuroanatomical, demographic and clinical characteristics of the subtypes discovered. methods we analyze the neuroanatomical heterogeneity of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, relative to a control population of subjects, using a machine learning method called chimera. chimera clusters the differences between patients and a demographically matched population of healthy subjects, rather than clustering patients themselves, thereby specifically assessing disease related neuroanatomical alterations. voxel based morphometry was conducted to visualize the neuroanatomical patterns associated with each group. the clinical presentation and the demographics of the groups were then investigated. results three subgroups were identified. the first two differed substantially, in that one involved predominantly temporal thalamic peri sylvian regions, whereas the other involved predominantly frontal regions and the thalamus. both subtypes included primarily male patients. the third pattern was a mix of these two and presented milder neuroanatomic alterations and comprised a comparable number of men and women. vbm and statistical analyses suggest that these groups could correspond to different neuroanatomical dimensions of schizophrenia. conclusion our analysis suggests that schizophrenia presents distinct neuroanatomical variants. this variability points to the need for a dimensional neuroanatomical approach using data driven, mathematically principled multivariate pattern analysis methods, and should be taken into account in clinical studies.","Large clinical studies and meta analyses report significant gray matter atrophy in the anterior cingulate, in medial and inferior frontal regions, in temporal lobes, in the hippocampus and the insula and in the thalamus (, , ).

821,"according to the national center of health statistics, cancer was the culprit of nearly 600,000 deaths in in the united states. it is by far one of the most heterogeneous diseases to treat. treatment for metastasized cancers remains a challenge despite modern diagnostics and treatment regimens. for this reason, alternative approaches are needed. chemoprevention using dietary phytochemicals such as triterpenoids, isothiocyanates, and curcumin in the prevention of initiation and/or progression of cancer poses a promising alternative strategy. however, significant challenges exist in the extrapolation of in vitro cell culture data to in vivo efficacy to animal models and particularly to human. in this review, the dose at which these phytochemicals elicit a response in vitro and in vivo of a multitude of cellular signaling pathways will be reviewed highlighting nrf2 mediated anti oxidative stress, anti inflammation, epigenetics, cytoprotection, differentiation, and growth inhibition. the in vitro in vivo dose response of phytochemicals can vary due in part to the cell line/animal model used, the assay system of the biomarker used for the readout, chemical structure of the functional analog of the phytochemical, and the source of compounds used for the treatment study. while the dose response varies across different experimental designs, the chemopreventive efficacy appears to remain and demonstrates the therapeutic potential of triterpenoids, isothiocyanates, and curcumin in cancer prevention and in health in general.","Cancer is now the leading cause of death in 21 states in the US .

828,"summary this study assessed the virulence of trypanosoma evansi, the causative agent of camel trypanosomiasis (surra), affecting mainly camels among other hosts in africa, asia and south america, with high mortality and morbidity. using swiss white mice, we assessed virulence of t. evansi isolates collected from surra endemic countries. we determined parasitaemia, live body weight, packed cell volume (pcv) and survivorship in mice, for a period of days post infection. based on survivorship, the isolates were classified into three virulence categories; low (3160 days), moderate (1130 days) and high (010 days). differences in survivorship, pcv and bodyweights between categories were significant and correlated (pg0.05). of the kenyan isolates, four were of low, five moderate and one (type b) of high virulence. these findings suggest differential virulence between t. evansi isolates. in conclusion, these results show that the virulence of t. evansi may be region specific, the phenotype of the circulating parasite should be considered in the management of surra. there is also need to collect more isolates from other surra endemic regions to confirm this observation.","Cattle and water buffalo are important for draught power, meat, milk, and also for capital investment for low income farmers in the affected areas . Depending on pathogen types, evolutionary outcomes may occur. Pathogens therefore run the risk of killing their host and completely lose their ongoing source of transmission to new hosts.All mice were acclimatized for two weeks, during which time they were screened and treated for the ecto and endo parasites using ivermectin (Ivermectin, Anupco, Suffolk, England (Ndungu et al. 2008). of the 10 kenyan isolates, four were of low, five moderate and one (type b) of high virulence. The sealed capillaries were centrifuged in a haematocrit centrifuge at 10062g, for 5 minutes.However, the factors underlying this difference in virulence levels are yet to be elucidated using molecular techniques. The increase could be related to the retention of body fluids in the form of oedema that accompanies trypanosomiasis . This helps the parasite to avoid elimination by specific potent immune responses and yield variants that proliferate and produce a new population.","Cattle and water buffalo are important for draught power, meat, milk, and also for capital investment for low income farmers in the affected areas .

831,"summary organisms can gain information about their environment from their ancestors, their parents, or their own personal experience. cue integration models often start with the simplifying assumption that information from different sources is additive. here, we test key assumptions and predictions of cue integration theory at both the phenotypic and molecular level in threespined sticklebacks (gasterosteus aculeatus). we show that regardless of whether cues about predation risk were provided by their father or acquired through personal experience, sticklebacks produced the same set of predator adapted phenotypes. moreover, there were nonadditive effects of personal and paternal experience: animals that received cues from both sources resembled animals that received cues from a single source. a similar pattern was detected at the molecular level: there was a core set of genes that were differentially expressed in the brains of offspring regardless of whether risk was experienced by their father, themselves or both. these results provide strong support for cue integration theory because they show that cues provided by parents and personal experience are comparable at both the phenotypic and molecular level, and draw attention to the importance of nonadditive responses to multiple cues.","Alternatively, additional cues mightdisproportionally increase the individuals confidence in the state of theenvironment, causing a multiplicative effect on the phenotype.

835,"currently, there are many papers that have been published on the detection and segmentation of lymph nodes from medical images. however, it is still a challenging problem owing to low contrast with surrounding soft tissues and the variations of lymph node size and shape on computed tomography (ct) images. this is particularly very difficult on low dose ct of pet/ct acquisitions. in this study, we utilize our previous automatic anatomy recognition (aar) framework to recognize the thoracic lymph node stations defined by the international association for the study of lung cancer (iaslc) lymph node map. the lymph node stations themselves are viewed as anatomic objects and are localized by using a one shot method in the aar framework. two strategies have been taken in this paper for integration into aar framework. the first is to combine some lymph node stations into composite lymph node stations according to their geometrical nearness. the other is to find the optimal parent (organ or union of organs) as an anchor for each lymph node station based on the recognition error and thereby find an overall optimal hierarchy to arrange anchor organs and lymph node stations. based on contrast enhanced thoracic ct image data sets for model building, independent data sets for testing, our results show that thoracic lymph node stations can be localized within voxels compared to the ground truth.","However, lymph node segmentation is challenging, and labor intensive and prone to variability and error when performed manually on computed tomography (CT) images.

841,"in an elegant example of bench to bedside research, a hypothesis that cells in the outflow pathway actively regulate conventional outflow resistance was proposed in the 1990s and systematically pursued, exposing novel cellular and molecular mechanisms of iop regulation. the critical discovery that pharmacological manipulation of the cytoskeleton of outflow pathway cells decreased outflow resistance placed a spotlight on the rho kinase pathway that was known to regulate the cytoskeleton. ultimately, a search for rho kinase inhibitors led to the discovery of several molecules of therapeutic interest, leaving us today with two new ocular hypotensive agents approved for clinical use ripasudil in japan and netarsudil in the us. these represent members of the first new class of clinically useful ocular hypotensive agents since the us fda approval of latanoprost in 1996. the development of rho kinase inhibitors as a class of medications to lower intraocular pressure in patients with glaucoma and ocular hypertension represents a triumph in translational research. rho kinase inhibitors are effective alone or when combined with other known ocular hypotensive medications. they also offer the possibility of neuroprotective activity, a favorable impact on ocular blood flow and even an anti fibrotic effect that may prove useful in conventional glaucoma surgery. local adverse effects, however, including conjunctival hyperemia, subconjunctival hemorrhages and cornea verticillata, are common. development of rho kinase inhibitors targeted to the cells of the outflow pathway and the retina may allow these agents to have even greater clinical impact. the objectives of this review are to describe the basic science underlying the development of rho kinase inhibitors as a therapy to lower intraocular pressure and to summarize the results of the clinical studies reported to date. the neuroprotective and vasoactive properties of rho kinase inhibitors as well as the antifibrotic properties of these agents are reviewed in the context of their possible role in the medical and surgical treatment of glaucoma.","Laser trabeculoplasty reduces trabecular outflow resistance and various surgical proceduresinvolve bypassing, incising or removing the trabecular meshwork.

843,"purpose: to estimate the ability of lower dose levels and iterative reconstruction (ir) to display hepatic metastases that can be detected by radiologists. materials and methods: projection data from contrast agentenhanced ct examinations were collected. metastases were defined by histopathologic analysis or progression and regression. lower radiation dose configurations were reconstructed at five dose levels with filtered back projection (fbp) and ir (automatic exposure control settings: 80, 100, 120, 160, and quality reference mas [qrm]). three abdominal radiologists circumscribed metastases, indicating confidence (confidence range, 0100) and image quality. noninferiority was assessed by using jackknife alternative free response receiver operating characteristic (jafroc) analysis (noninferiority limit, 0.10) and reader agreement rules, which required identification of metastases identified at routine dose, and no nonlesion localizations in patients negative for metastases, in or more patient ct examinations (of 83), for each configuration. results: there were hepatic metastases (mean size, 1.4 cm; median volume ct dose index and size specific dose estimate, 11.0 and 13.4 mgy, respectively). by using jafroc figure of merit, qrm fbp did not meet noninferiority criteria and had estimated performance difference from routine dose of 0.08 (95% confidence interval: 0.11, 0.04). preset reader agreement rules were not met for qrm ir or qrm ir, but were met for doses qrm or higher (ie, size specific dose estimate 8.0 mgy). ir improved image quality (p < .05) but not reader performance. other than qrm ir, lower dose levels were associated with reduced confidence in metastasis detection (p < .001). conclusion: for detection of hepatic metastases by using contrast enhanced ct, dose levels that corresponded to quality reference mas (size specific dose estimate, 8.0 mgy) and higher performed similarly to quality reference mas with filtered back projection.","The American Association of Physicists in Medicine also published abdominopelvic CT protocols for differently sized patients that use a similar dose range .

844,"objective: mln4924, a pharmacological inhibitor of cullin neddylation, resulted in glioma cell apoptosis, deregulation of the s phase of dna synthesis and thus, offers great potential for the treatment of brain tumours. however, targeting the neddylation pathway with an mln4924 treatment stabilized the hypoxia inducible factor 1a (hif1a), which is one of the main transcriptional enhancers of the immune checkpoint molecule pdl1 (programmid death ligand 1) in cancer cells. the influence of immune checkpoint molecules on glioma progression has recently been discovered; pdl1 overexpression in gliomas corresponds to a significant shortening of patient survival and a decrease of the anti tumour immune response. we hypothesize that i) pdl1 is up regulated in gliomas after treatment with mln4924 and induces t cell energy; ii) co utilization of the pd1/pdl1 blockage with mln4924 therapy may reduce t cell energy and may engage mln4924 induced tumour disruption with the immune response. methods: pdl1 expression and its immunosuppressive role in gliomas, glioma microenvironments, and after treatments with mln4924 were assessed by utilizing methods of immunohistochemistry, molecular biology, and biochemistry. results: we confirmed pdl1 overexpression in clinical brain tumour samples, pdgx and established glioma cell lines, extracellular media from glioma cells, and csf (cerebrospinal fluid) samples from tumour bearing mice. our primary t cell based assays verified that the up regulation of pdl1 in tumour cells protects gliomas from t cell treatment and reduces t cell activation. we found that a pharmacological inhibitor of cullin neddylation, mln4924, exhibited strong cytotoxicity towards pdgx and established glioma cell lines, in vitro, with an ic50s range from 0.2 to um. however, we observed a significant increase of hif1a and pdl1 in mrna and protein levels in all glioma cell lines after treatment with mln4924. the mln4924 dependent induction of pdl1 in gliomas resulted in t cell energy, which was blocked by a blockage of the pd1/pdl1 interaction. conclusion: we conclude that i) pdl1 up regulation in gliomas and the glioma microenvironment is an important chemotherapeutic target; ii) mln4924 therapy, combined with a blockage of the pd1/pdl1 pathway, should be considered as a potential strategy for glioma treatment.","Programmed death ligand 1 (PDL1) is a major immunological checkpoint ligand molecule, and it is up regulated in tumors and tumor microenvironments of different types of cancer [ ].

DTI measures the multidirectional profile of water diffusion in tissue.We renormalized GA by applying the hyperbolic tangent transformation to the GA values (tGA) as in , to create maps with a comparable range to the FA . From the resulting deformation fields, Jacobian matrices were obtained . From the DICOM DT MR images, diffusion tensors (3x3 positive symmetric matrices) were computed and smoothed using Log Euclidean tensor denoising to eliminate singular, negative definite, or rank deficient tensors, using MedINRIA (http://www.sop.inria.fr/asclepios/software/MedINRIA) .10.1109/ISBI.2010.5490199 We first transformed the diffusion tensors to the log Euclidean domain via matrix logarithm transformation.

857,"circadian rhythms describe the behavioral and physiological changes that occur in living organisms in order to attune to a hour cycle of day and night. the most striking aspect of circadian function is the sleep wake cycle, however many other physiological processes are regulated in hour oscillations, including blood pressure, body temperature, appetite, urine production, and the transcription and translation of thousands of circadian dependent genes. circadian disruption and sleep disorders are strongly connected to neurodegenerative diseases including parkinsons disease, alzheimers disease, and huntingtons disease as well as others. metal exposures have been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, in some cases involving metals that are essential micronutrients but are toxic at high levels of exposure (such as manganese, copper, and zinc), and in other cases involving metals that have no biological role but are toxic to living systems (such as lead, mercury, and aluminum). in this review, we examine the evidence for circadian and sleep disorders with exposures to these metals and review the literature for possible mechanisms. we suggest that giving the aging population, the prevalence of environmental exposures to metals, and the increasing prevalence of neurodegenerative disease in the aged, more research into the mechanisms of circadian disruption subsequent to metal exposures is warranted.","Peripheral clocks also exist in organs such as the liver, lung and kidney , and circadian oscillations are seen at the level of individual cells.

867,"epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr) is a well characterized protooncogene that has been shown to promote tumor progression in solid cancers. clinical results for egfr targeting with specific monoclonal antibodies (mabs) such as cetuximab and panitumumab are promising; however, most studies indicate that only a subgroup of patients receiving the mabs benefit from the immunotherapy, independent of egfr expression level. to understand the in vivo kinetics of antibody delivery and localization, we performed small animal pet studies with 64cu labeled panitumumab in xenografts derived from cell lines of human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (hnscc). methods: nude mice bearing hnscc tumors with different levels of egfr expression were imaged with small animal pet using 64cu 1,4,7,10 tetraazacyclododecane n,n,n,n tetraacetic acid (dota) panitumumab. antibody distribution in the tumors was confirmed by ex vivo immunostaining using panitumumab and fluorescein 5(6) isothiocyanate (fitc) panitumumab. cd31 immunostaining and evans blue assay were also performed to assess the tumor vascular density and permeability. results: among these tumor models, um scc 22b tumors with the lowest egfr protein expression showed the highest 64cu dota panitumumab accumulation, whereas sqb20 tumors with the highest egfr expression showed the lowest 64cu dota panitumumab accumulation. ex vivo staining demonstrated that sqb20 cells still had extremely high egfr expression after forming tumors in nude mice, indicating that the low uptake of 64cu dota panitumumab in sqb20 tumors was not due to the loss of egfr expression. the results from cd31 immunostaining and evans blue permeability assay suggest that the low vessel density, poor vascular permeability, and binding site barrier are likely responsible for the overall low tumor uptake of the highly egfr expressing sqb20 tumors. conclusion: the results from this study provide a possible explanation for the lack of an observed correlation between therapeutic efficacy of cetuximab and panitumumab and egfr expression level as determined by immunohistochemistry or fluorescent in situ hybridization and may shed new light on the complications of anti egfr mab therapy for hnscc and other malignancies.","It has been demonstrated that noninvasive molecular imaging can provide additional diagnostic information to improve patient management .

The first case was scored as N1, since an increase in theta (4 7 Hz) and a decrease in alpha (7 14 Hz) power was observed in more than half of the 30 second scoring epoch, meeting the AASM criteria for classification of stage N1 sleep. In the N2 instance, the participant reported only a brief moment of lucidity just before waking up.Despite having been physiologically validated for approximately four decades, the neurobiology of lucid dreaming is still incompletely characterized. However, refinement of the instructions given to participants, as described above, could help further increase the reliability of the technique. Stimulation was delivered through two pairs of electrodes with anodes at positions F3 and F4, respectively, and cathodes at the supraclavicular area of the same side.","Finally, we present strategies to measure lucid dreaming both physiologically and with questionnaires, and discuss procedures to investigate lucid dreaming in the sleep laboratory .

873,"doped metal oxide materials are commonly used for applications in energy storage and conversion, such as batteries and solid oxide fuel cells. the knowledge of the electronic properties of dopants and their local environment is essential for understanding the effects of doping on the electrochemical properties. using a combination of x ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy (xanes) experiment and theoretical modeling we demonstrate that in the dilute (1 at. %) mn doped lithium titanate (li4/3ti5/3o4, or lto) the dopant mn2+ ions reside on tetrahedral (8a) sites. first principles mn k edge xanes calculations revealed the spectral signature of the tetrahedrally coordinated mn as a sharp peak in the middle of the absorption edge rise, caused by the 1s 4p transition, and it is important to include the effective electron core hole coulomb interaction in order to calculate the intenisty of this peak accurately. this dopant location explains the impedance of li migration through the lto lattice during the charge discharge process, and, as a result the observed remarkable 20% decrease in electrochemical rate performance of the 1% mn doped lto compared to the pristine lto.","While XANES modelling is still a challenging problem in general, the progress achieved during the last decades in developing theoretical XANES codes enables the use of XANES for quantitative analysis of molecular and bulk compounds .

874,"many longitudinal studies have investigated whether self esteem predicts depressive symptoms (vulnerability model) or the other way around (scar model) in adolescents. the most common method of analysis has been the cross lagged panel model (clpm). the clpm does not separate between person effects from within person effects, making it unclear whether the results from previous studies actually reflect the within person effects, or whether they reflect differences between people. we investigated the associations between self esteem and depressive symptoms at the within person level, using random intercept cross lagged panel models (ri clpm). to get an impression of the magnitude of possible differences between the ri clpm and clpm, we compared the results of both models. we used data from three longitudinal adolescent samples (age range 718; study 1: n=1,948; study 2: n=1,455; study 3: n=316). intervals between the measurements were 11.5 years. single paper meta analyses showed support for small within person associations from self esteem to depressive symptoms, but not the other way around, thus only providing some support for the vulnerability model. the cross lagged associations in the aggregated ri clpm and clpm showed similar effect sizes. overall, our results show that over 11.5 year time intervals, low self esteem may negatively influence depressive symptoms over time within adolescents, but only weakly so.","Of course, these models are not mutually exclusive; reciprocalassociations between self esteem and depression are possible .

877,"the work of first responders is fraught with numerous stressors, ranging from potentially traumatic critical incidents to institutional strains. the severity and pervasiveness of these difficulties prompt a necessary consideration of the coping methods employed by first responders. the present study developed an empirical model of first responder coping strategies, based upon a nationally representative survey sample of first responders. participants were drawn from swedish first responders in the following occupations: coast guard, customs control, military, emergency medical services, fire department and police services. in the final model, exposure to stress related to well being through several indirect paths that in sum accounted for the original direct relationship between these constructs. these several indirect paths were classified theoretically as either approach or avoidance coping behaviours or subsequent health outcomes. in general, approach coping behaviours were related to better well being; and avoidance was related to a decrease in the outcome. the size of the present sample, as well as the diverse nature of the included first responders, suggests that the resulting model may offer a unique insight into potentially adaptive pathways for first responder coping.","Although the specific nature of the tasks assigned to these offices is widely discrepant, all are united by the highly demanding nature of their work and their routine exposure to both physical and psychological stressors (e.g. ; ).

885,"although the role of estrogen in solid cancers has been widely investigated, its effect in hematologic malignancies including multiple myeloma (mm) is not known. here, we utilized a syngeneic mouse model of mm to address this question. in this model, treatment with 17 estradiol significantly promoted progression of the disease. this effect has not been attributed to the direct effect of estrogen on mm cells but rather was mediated through estrogen induced alterations in tumor microenvironment. in mm bone marrow, myeloid derived suppressor cells (mdscs) represent one of the major cellular populations. 17 estradiol did not promote expansion and accumulation of mdscs. however, it significantly increased their ability to suppress t cells proliferation. thus, these data demonstrated that estrogen promotes progression of mm by enhancing an immunosuppressive function of the bone marrow mdscs.","Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable cancer of plasma cells that preferentially localize in the bone marrow (BM).

892,"background recent studies show that greater price variability and more opportunities for tax avoidance are associated with tax structures that depart from a specific uniform one. these findings indicate that tax structures other than a specific uniform one may lead to more cigarette consumption. objective this paper aims to examine how cigarette tax structure is associated with cigarette consumption. methods we used survey data taken from the international tobacco control policy evaluation project in countries to conduct the analysis. self reported cigarette consumption was aggregated to average measures for each surveyed country and wave. the effect of tax structures on cigarette consumption was estimated using generalized estimating equations after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, average taxes and year fixed effects. findings our study provides important empirical evidence of a relationship between tax structure and cigarette consumption. we find that a change from a specific to an ad valorem structure is associated with a 6%11% higher cigarette consumption. in addition, a change from uniform to tiered structure is associated with a 34%65% higher cigarette consumption. the results are consistent with existing evidence and suggest that a uniform and specific tax structure is the most effective tax structure for reducing tobacco consumption.","In recent years, a growing body of literature investigated how complicated tax structuresad valorem, tiered and mixedare associated with price distribution.

895,"sexual assault (sa) is associated with increased risk for chronic pain, but the mechanisms for this relationship are poorly understood. to explore whether disrupted descending inhibition is involved, this study used a conditioned pain modulation (cpm) task to study inhibition of pain and the nociceptive flexion reflex (nfr; a correlate of spinal nociception) in pain free sa survivors. this group was compared to pain free, trauma exposed persons without sa (no sa group) and a group of pain free persons who reported no trauma exposure (no te). cpm was assessed from painful electric stimulations (test stimulus) delivered to the ankle before, during, and after participants submerged their hand in painful 10c water (conditioning stimulus). pain ratings and nfr were assessed in response to test stimuli. all groups demonstrated significant inhibition of pain during cpm. however, only the no te group demonstrated significant inhibition of nfr. the no sa group showed no inhibition of nfr, whereas the sa group showed significant facilitation of nfr. these findings suggest that trauma exposure may impair inhibitory cerebrospinal circuits, but that sa may specifically promote facilitation of spinal nociception. perspective: this study suggests trauma exposure disrupts cerebrospinal inhibition of spinal nociception but that exposure to sexual assault further promotes chronic pain risk by facilitating spinal nociception. this help may help elucidate the pain risk mechanisms in trauma survivors.","Sexual assault (SA), defined as exposure to any nonconsensual sexual act, occurs in 1 in 4 women and 1 in 100 men, with a new incident occurring every 98 seconds in the U.S..

902,"the purpose of the current study is to provide guidance on a process for including latent class predictors in regression mixture models. we first examine the performance of current practice for using the 1 step and 3 step approaches where the direct covariate effect on the outcome is omitted. none of the approaches show adequate estimates of model parameters. given that the step 1 of the three step approach shows adequate results in class enumeration, we suggest using an alternative approach: 1) decide the number of latent classes without predictors of latent classes and 2) bring the latent class predictors into the model with the inclusion of hypothesized direct covariates effects. our simulations show that this approach leads to good estimates for all model parameters. the proposed approach is demonstrated by using empirical data to examine the differential effects of family resources on students academic achievement outcome. implications of the study are discussed.","The second approach starts by estimating the latent class portion of the model in isolation and then brings in predictors of the latent classes. We first overview regression mixture models and review previous studies examining the model building process in latent class analysis . This is typically accomplished by including predictors of the latent classes in the mixture model .While some studies argue that the one step approach results in more reliable parameter estimates , other studies argue that the three step approach more closely follows the logic of the typical latent class analyses. In practice it is common to assume that class predictors are unrelated to outcomes (; , ; ).

We first overview regression mixture models and review previous studies examining the model building process in latent class analysis . This is typically accomplished by including predictors of the latent classes in the mixture model .While some studies argue that the one step approach results in more reliable parameter estimates , other studies argue that the three step approach more closely follows the logic of the typical latent class analyses.

903,"purpose the present study assesses the intergenerational labeling hypothesis and examines whether the relationship between a childs involuntary contact with the police and subsequent offending depends on parental arrest history (and its timing in the life course of the child) and parent sex. methods using data from parent child dyads from the rochester youth development study and rochester intergenerational study, generalized linear regression models estimate the main and interactive effects of a childs involuntary contact and parental arrest history on subsequent delinquency as well as potential mechanisms for deviance amplification. results main effects are consistent with labeling theory and moderation analyses reveal that the impact of involuntary contact on subsequent delinquency depends on parental arrest history. more specifically, contact with the police on subsequent offending is greater when the focal parent has an arrest history, regardless of when the most recent arrest occurs in the life course of the child. however, some differences in the magnitude of the exacerbating effect of recent parental arrest emerged. results also speak to potential mechanisms across mother child and father child dyads with respect to deviance amplification. conclusions this research supports the life course principles of linked lives and timing in lives and their application to labeling theory in an intergenerational context. to reduce deviance amplification, special attention should be paid to youth who experience a police contact in the context of a parental arrest history.","To do so, we use prospective, longitudinal data from parent child dyads who participated in the Rochester YouthDevelopment Survey (RYDS) and the Rochester Intergenerational Study (RIGS). Still, given the nontrivial cumulative prevalence rates of arrest through early adulthood,it is imperative to better understand the short and long term consequences of arrest . The results of this effort will speak not only to the intergenerational consequences of arrestbut also inform theoretical and policy discussions on the consequences of criminal justice intervention and efforts to reduce recidivismamong juvenile delinquents .The deviance amplification thesis derived from the labeling perspective introduced the notion that social reactions,particularly those of the criminal justice system, could have the unintended effect of increasing subsequent criminal offending. However, less is known about the impact of the broader familial and historical context in which an offspringspolice contact occurs.

904,"background: there is a clinical need to be able to reliably detect meaningful changes (0.1 to 0.2 m/s) in usual gait speed (ugs) considering reduced gait speed is associated with morbidity and mortality. research question: what is the impact of tester on ugs assessment, and the influence of test repetition (trial vs. 2), timing method (manual stopwatch vs. automated timing), and starting condition (stationary vs. dynamic start) on the ability to detect changes in ugs and fast gait speed (fgs)? methods: ugs and fgs was assessed in participants on a 8 m course with infrared timing gates positioned at 0, 2, and m. testing was performed by one of testers trained by a single researcher. time to walk 4 m from a stationary start (i.e. from 0 m to 4 m) was measured manually using a stopwatch and automatically via the timing gates at 0 m and 4 m. time taken to walk 4 m with a dynamic start was measured during the same trial by recording the time to walk between the timing gates at 2 m and 6 m (i.e. after 2 m acceleration). results: testers differed for ugs measured using manual vs. automated timing (p=0.02), with five and two testers recording slower and faster ugs using manual timing, respectively. 95% limits of agreement for trial vs. 2, manual vs. automated timing, and dynamic vs. stationary start ranged from 0.15 m/s to 0.20 m/s, coinciding with the range for a clinically meaningful change. limits of agreement for fgs were larger ranging from 0.26 m/s to 0.35 m/s. significance: repeat testing of ugs should performed by the same tester or using an automated timing method to control for tester effects. test protocol should remain constant both between and within participants as protocol deviations may result in detection of an artificial clinically meaningful change.","Reductions in usual gait speed (UGS) below 1.0 m/s are associated with declines in health and life expectancy .

905,"objective: prior research has revealed a link between peer victimization and somatic complaints in healthy youth; however, the peer victimization experiences of youth with clinically significant chronic pain have not been examined. this study aims to determine rates of peer victimization among youth seeking treatment for chronic pain and to compare these rates to a community control group. relationships between peer victimization, depressive symptoms, and functional disability are also examined. method: one hundred forty three adolescents (70 with chronic pain) completed measures assessing their experience of traditional (physical, relational, reputational) and cyber based peer victimization, as well as measures assessing their depressive symptoms and pain related functional disability. results: peer victimization experiences were common among youth with and without chronic pain. within the chronic pain group, there were differences in rates of peer victimization as a function of the adolescents school setting. adolescents with chronic pain attending traditional schools reported more frequent peer victimization experiences than adolescents with pain not enrolled in school or attending online/home school. within the chronic pain sample, peer victimization was moderately associated with depressive symptoms and functional disability. tests of a simple mediation model revealed a significant indirect effect of peer victimization on functional disability, through depression. conclusions: these results are the first to systematically document the peer victimization experiences of adolescents with chronic pain. peer victimization is commonly experienced, particularly for those enrolled in traditional school settings. associations with depressive symptoms and functional disability suggest that peer victimization may be a useful target for intervention.","Recently, there has been growing interest in cyber victimization, or acts of peer based aggression (threats, insults, harassment, and exclusion) that take place via information and communication technologies, including texts, emails, and social media postings . In that study, peer victimization also uniquely contributed to negative academic and social outcomes, especially for children experiencing the highest levels of pain and peer victimization.

906,"introduction and objective: readmission rates after radical cystectomy are among the highest of any surgery. the hospital readmissions reduction program (hrrp) penalizes hospitals with excess readmissions for certain targeted conditions, including total hip and knee arthroplasty. we examined whether changes made by hospitals in response to the hrrp had spillover effects on radical cystectomy readmissions. methods: we used a 20% sample of medicare data to identify patients undergoing cystectomy from to and measured 30 day adjusted cystectomy readmission rates. to determine the effect of the hrrp, we calculated adjusted readmission rates following total hip or knee arthroplasty and stratified hospitals into quartiles (most improved, middle quartiles, least improved) based on their improvement in reducing those targeted readmissions. multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with spillover effects from the targeted joint surgery to cystectomy. results: we identified 2,394 patients undergoing radical cystectomy. of these, were treated at hospitals in the most improved quartile and in the least improved. patients undergoing cystectomy were similar in age, comorbidity, and sec independent of hospital performance quartile. the readmission rate following cystectomy was 26% in the most improved quartile and 24% in the least improved. no spillover effect was identified between readmission reduction after major joint surgery and radical cystectomy (adjusted or 0.90, p=0.42). conclusions: hospitals that succeeded in reducing readmissions following major joint surgery targeted by the hrrp did not have similar reductions in readmissions following radical cystectomy. this lack of spillover effect suggests that each surgical condition may require tailored interventions to prevent readmissions.","Furthermore, these readmissions are expensive , and associated with an increased risk of dying .

909,"introduction: abnormalities in the corpus callosum (cc) and the lateral ventricles (lv) are hallmark features of schizophrenia. these abnormalities have been reported in chronic and in first episode schizophrenia (fesz). here we explore further associations between cc and lv in fesz using diffusion tensor imaging (dti). methods: . sixteen fesz patients and healthy controls (hc), matched on age, gender, and handedness participated in the study. diffusion and structural imaging scans were acquired on a 3t ge signa magnet. volumetric measures for lv and dti measures for five cc subdivisions were completed in both groups. in addition, two tensor tractography, the latter corrected for free water (fat), was completed for cc. correlations between lv and dti measures of the cc were examined in both groups, while correlations between dti and clinical measures were examined in only fesz. results: results from two tensor tractography demonstrated decreased fat and increased trace and radial diffusivity (rdt) in the five cc subdivisions in fesz compared to hc. central cc diffusion measures in fesz were significantly correlated with volume of the lv, i.e., decreased fat values were associated with larger lv volume, while increased rdt and trace values were associated with larger lv volume. in controls, correlations were also significant, but they were in the opposite direction from fesz. in addition, decreased fat in fesz was associated with more positive symptoms. discussion: partial volume corrected fat, rdt, and trace abnormalities in the cc in fesz suggest possible de or dys myelination, or changes in axonal diameters, all compatible with neurodevelopmental theories of schizophrenia. correlational findings between the volume of lv and diffusion measures in fesz reinforce the concept of a link between abnormalities in the lv and cc in early stages of schizophrenia and are also compatible with neurodevelopmental abnormalities in this population.","Restriction that varies depending on the direction is referred to as fractional anisotropy (FA), and is a commonly used diffusion measure (e.g., ).

911,"objectives frailty is increasingly recognized as a key determinant in predicting postoperative outcomes. centers that see more frail patients may not be captured in risk adjustment, potentially accounting for poorer outcomes in hospital comparisons. we aimed to 1) determine the effect of frailty on long term mortality in patients undergoing elective abdominal aortic aneurysm (aaa) repair and 2) evaluate the variability in frailty burden among centers in the vascular quality initiative (vqi) database. methods patients undergoing elective open and endovascular aaa repair (20032017) were identified and those with complete data on component variables of the vqi derived risk analysis index (vqi rai) and centers with aaa repairs were included. vqi rai characteristics are: sex, age, body mass index, renal failure, congestive heart failure, dyspnea, preoperative ambulation and functional status. frailty was defined as vqi rai based on prior work in surgical patients using other quality improvement databases. this corresponds to the top 12% of patients at risk in the vqi. center level vqi rai differences were assessed by analysis of variance (anova) test. relationships between frailty and survival were compared by kaplan meier analysis and log rank test for open and endovascular procedures. multivariable hierarchical cox proportional hazards regression models were calculated with random intercepts for center, controlling for frailty, race, insurance, aaa diameter, procedure type, aaa case mix, and year. results a total of 15,803 patients from centers were included. vqi rai scores ranged from to (mean 27.6, sd 5.9) and varied significantly across centers (f=2.41, p<0.001). the percentage of frail patients per center ranged from 040.0%. in multivariable analysis, frailty was independently associated with long term mortality (hazard ratio 2.88, 95% ci 2.63.2) after accounting for covariates and center level variance. open aaa repair was not associated with long term mortality after adjusting for frailty (hazard ratio 0.98, 0.861.13). there was a statistically significant difference in the percentage of frail patients compared to non frail patients who were discharged to a rehabilitation facility or nursing home following both open (40.5% vs. 17.8%, p<0.0001) and endovascular repair (17.7% vs. 4.6%, p<0.0001). conclusions there is considerable variability of preoperative frailty among vqi centers performing elective aaa repair. adjusting for center level variation, frailty but not procedure type had a significant association with long term mortality; however, both frailty and procedure type were associated with non home discharge. routine measurement of frailty preoperatively by centers to identify high risk patients may help mitigate procedural and long term outcomes and improve shared decision making regarding aaa repair.","Regardless of the measure, frailty has been shown to be an independent risk factor for poor outcomes across surgical specialties, including vascular surgery. We plan to investigate the distribution of frailty across centers performing AAA repair, and our hypothesis is that frailty will be a predictor of long term survival following OAR and EVAR when adjusting for center level variance . The introduction of endovascular techniques has allowed us to offer a wider array of interventions to patients who would have otherwise been considered poor candidates for open repair.1) a prospective survey (RAI C) administered pre operatively by clinic staff or providers, and Differences in postoperative discharge destination were evaluated with Fishers exact tests.

Compared to commercial insurance, Medicare was associated with increased mortality hazard (HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.211.54, p < 0.001); however, Medicaid was not (HR 1.35, 95% CI 0.931.95).

913,"introduction: salivary duct carcinoma (sdc) is a high grade salivary gland carcinoma that is associated with frequent metastasis and poor outcome. androgen receptor (ar) immunoexpression in sdc is reported in 69% to 100% sdc. androgen deprivation therapy (adt) has shown a response rate of 18% to 42% in sdc. therefore, ar immunoexpression may serve as a diagnostic and predictive marker for adt response in sdc. methods: we investigated ar immunopositivity and staining pattern in a large retrospective cohort of sdcs from patients, including paired primary and metastatic sdcs from the same patients, focusing specifically on staining heterogeneity and concordance. a control cohort of non sdc salivary gland carcinomas was also included. results: ar immunopositivity defined as 1% of tumor cell nuclear staining was found in 94% (177/188) of sdcs, including 95% of primary tumors, 100% of regional metastases, and 90% of distant metastases. most of the cases (75%, 86/114) showed homogeneous and diffuse ar positivity. however, a subset (25%) exhibited focal or heterogeneous ar staining pattern. although most metastases (21/22, 95%) had concordant ar expression with the primary tumors, one treatment nave tumor (5%) had complete loss of ar immunoexpression in the metastasis without detectable molecular alterations in ar or ar co regulators. ar positive staining in non sdc salivary carcinomas was infrequent (15%, 9/61), and mostly heterogeneous or focal. conclusion: ar immunoexpression is highly prevalent in sdc, in both primary (94%) and metastatic tumors (93%). the cumulative ar immunopositivity rate in sdc is 90% based on data from the current study and previous literature. a small subset may show intratumoral ar heterogeneity and discordant ar expression in metastasis. ar immunoexpression may be seen in non sdc salivary gland carcinomas but it is uncommon and usually focal.","Given the reported high frequency of AR immunopositivity and the potential therapeutic application of ADT in SDC, AR immunohistochemistry (IHC) becomes a widely used diagnostic marker and a possible predictive biomarker for these patients.

914,"mugwort pollen allergy is frequent in parts of europe. as mugwort pollen contains only one major allergen, art v 1, which harbors only one t cell epitope, we employed mugwort pollen allergy as a model to study allergen specific t cell responses. however, after 2004, we noticed a drastic decrease in the t cell responses to art v and eventually it became almost impossible to detect allergen specific responses at the t cell level in mugwort allergic individuals. to explain this observation, we retrospectively investigated the local exposure to mugwort pollen and its possible correlation to the frequency and reactivity of allergen specific t cells. the total annual pollen indices dramatically dropped after and never reached previous levels again. local sensitization to mugwort pollen and serum ige antibodies specific for art v remained unchanged until 2015. our mugwort pollen model shows that specific ige levels are maintained for extremely long time periods in spite of a long term reduction of natural allergen exposure to levels that are too low to boost specific t cells.","During the last decade we observed a markedlydiminished T cell response to Art v 1, despite the fact that blood sampling wasalways done within or shortly after the pollen season, using the same parameters forpatient selection and in vitro culture systems validated by negative and positivecontrol cultures .

915,"background: epidemiological reports indicate that mood related disorders are common in the adolescent population. the prevalence of juvenile major depressive disorder has resulted in a parallel increase in the prescription rates of fluoxetine (flx) within this age group. although such treatment can last for years, little is known about the enduring consequences of adolescent antidepressant exposure on memory related performance. methods: we exposed separate groups of adolescent (postnatal day [pd] 35) male and female c57bl/6 mice to flx (20 mg/kg) for consecutive days (pd3549). three weeks after flx exposure (pd70), we assessed learning and memory performance on a single day training object novelty recognition test, or a spatial memory task on the morris water maze (mwm). results: we found that flx pretreatment did not influence performance on either the object novelty recognition task or the mwm, hr after training. conversely, hr post spatial training on the mwm, flx pretreated male mice spent significantly less time on the quadrant of the missing platform during a standard probe trial. no differences in mwm performance were observed in the adult female mice pretreated with flx. limitations: a limitation of this study is that normal adolescent mice (i.e., non stressed) were evaluated for memory related behavior three weeks after antidepressant exposure. thus, it is possibility that flx pre exposure in combination with animal models for the study of depression may yield different results. conclusion: together, these results demonstrate enduring spatial memory related deficiencies after pre exposure to flx during adolescence in male, but not female, c57bl/6 mice.","For example, adolescent exposure to FLX modifies the reward valence of both natural and drug (Flores Ramirez et al., 2018; ) rewards later in life; per the sucrose and cocaine place conditioning behavioral paradigms.

918,"hepatic steatosis occurs when lipids accumulate in the liver leading to steatohepatitis, which can evolve into cirrhosis and consequently may end with hepatocellular carcinoma. several automatic classification algorithms have been proposed to detect liver diseases. however, some algorithms are manufacturer dependent, while others require extensive calculations and consequently prolonged computational time. this may limit the development of real time and manufacturer independent computer aided detection of liver steatosis. this work demonstrates the feasibility of a computationally efficient and manufacturer independent wavelet based computer aided liver steatosis detection system using conventional b mode ultrasound (us) imaging. seven features were extracted from the approximation part of the second level wavelet packet transform (wpt) of us images. the proposed technique was tested on two datasets of ex vivo mice livers with and without gelatin embedding, in addition to a third dataset of in vivo human livers acquired using two different us machines. using the gelatin embedded mice liver dataset, the technique exhibited 98.8% accuracy, 97.8% sensitivity, and 100% specificity, and the frame classification time was reduced from 0.4814 s using original us images to 0.1444 s after wpt preprocessing. when the other mice liver dataset was used, the technique showed 85.74% accuracy, 84.4% sensitivity, and 88.5% specificity, and the frame classification time was reduced from 0.5612s to 0.2903 s. using human liver image data, the best classifier exhibited 92.5% accuracy, 93.0% sensitivity, 91.0% specificity, and the classification time was reduced from 0.660 s to 0.146 s. this technique can be useful for developing computationally efficient and manufacturer independent noninvasive cad systems for fatty liver detection.","The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Liver fat accumulation occurs due to hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, and hepatic accumulation of triglycerides (TG) producing an imbalance between increased free fatty acid (FFA) flux from adipose tissues to the liver, increased caloric intake, and increased de novo lipogenesis in the liver and liver handling and export of the extra fat . However, US imaging is both operator and machine dependent, and can only detect livers with more than 30% steatosis .2.1. For each US B mode image, a region of interest (ROI) is selected.

919,"abnormal tau hyperphosphorylation and its aggregation into neurofibrillary tangles are a hallmark of tauopathies, neurodegenerative disorders that include alzheimers disease (ad). active and passive tau immunotherapy has been proposed as a therapeutic approach to ad with mixed results. one of the limitations of active immunotherapy may be associated with the mediocre immunogenicity of vaccines that are not inducing therapeutically potent titers of antibodies. the aim of this study was to test the efficacy of an anti tau vaccine, av 1980r/a composed of n terminal peptide of this molecule fused with an immunogenic multitep platform and formulated in a strong adjuvant, advaxcpg in a tg4510 mouse model of tauopathy. experimental mice were immunized with av 1980r/a and a control group of mice were injected with adjuvant only. nontransgenic and tetracycline transactivator (tta) transgenic littermates were included as baseline controls to contrast with the tau phenotype. active immunization with av 1980r/a induced very strong anti tau humoral immune responses in both nontransgenic and transgenic mice with evidence of igg in brains of av 1980r/a vaccinated mice. these experimental animals displayed an improvement in short term memory during a novel object recognition test. however, impairments in other behavioral tasks were not prevented by av 1980r/a vaccinations. at the same time, high titers of anti tau antibodies reduced hyperphosphorylated pser396 tau but did not lower the level of other phosphorylated tau species in the brains of av 1980r/a vaccinated mice. these data indicate that active immunotherapy with an n terminal tau epitope was only partially effective in improving cognition and reducing pathology in the stringent tg4510 mouse model of tauopathy.","Indeed, NFTs are observed early in the pathogenesis of AD and increase during aging . As such, there is a possibility that targeting tau may represent a more effective method of treating AD than removing A if a patient is already exhibiting clear signs of cognitive impairments. In fact, intracranial administration of monoclonal antibody targeting PAD motif reduced total tau and phosphorylated forms of tau in brains of Thy Tau22 tau transgenic mice .Tg4510 mice aged 3 months old received a total of 7 immunizations with either AdvaxCpG adjuvant (n = 12) or the tau vaccine, AV 1980R/A (n = 12). Due to the strong antibody response (see below), the vaccine dose was decreased from 40 micrograms to 20 micrograms after injection 4. Mice of both sexes were included in each treatment condition .Disadvantages include a high frequency of dosing (typically monthly by infusion) and the considerable costs associated with antibody production and delivery . However, in the same paper they reported much larger reductions in the phenotype of the P301S tau model PS19.

920,"research indicates that sleep duration and quality are inter related factors that contribute to obesity, but few studies have focused on sleep chronotype, representing an individuals circadian proclivity, nor assessed these factors in racially diverse middle aged samples. we examined the associations between chronotype and obesity among black and white men and women participating in the bogalusa heart study (bhs). body mass index (bmi) and sleep data were available for 1,197 middle aged men and women (mean age 48.25.3 years) who participated in the bhs 20132016. based on the reduced morningness eveningness questionnaires cutoff values for chronotypes, we combined definitely morning and moderately morning types into morning type, definitely evening and moderately evening types into evening type and kept those who were neither type in a separate group. we used morning type as the referent group. obesity was defined as a bmi 30. multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine associations adjusting for sex, age, education, smoking, alcohol use and drug use, depression, shift work, physical activity and sleep duration. evening chronotype, reported by 11.1% of participants, was associated with obesity after multi variable adjustment, including shift work, physical activity and sleep duration (or 1.67, 95% ci: 1.082.56). however, once stratified by race (black/white), this association was found only among white participants (or=1.91, 95% ci=1.123.25) after full adjustment. in our biracial, community based population, evening chronotype was independently associated with obesity, specifically among white participants. further research is needed to identify behavioral, endocrine, nutritional and genetic pathways which underlie these associations.","Morning chronotype may be related to successful weight maintenance as well . Ethnic disparities in obesity prevalence, for example, between Hispanic and non Hispanic black adults have been identified and explained by biological, behavioral, and socioenvironmental factors such as genetics, diet and physical activity, sedentary lifestyles and neighborhood .

922,"beats are among the basic units of perceptual experience. produced by regular, intermittent stimulation, beats are most commonly associated with audition, but the experience of a beat can result from stimulation in other modalities as well. we studied the robustness of visual, vibrotactile, and bimodal signals as sources of beat perception. subjects attempted to discriminate between pulse trains delivered at hz or at hz. to investigate signal robustness, we intentionally degraded signals on two thirds of the trials using temporal domain noise. on these trials, inter pulse intervals (ipis) were stochastic, perturbed independently from the nominal ipi by random samples from zero mean gaussian distributions with different variances. these perturbations produced directional changes in the ipis, which either increased or decreased the likelihood of confusing the two pulse rates. in addition to affording an assay of signal robustness, this paradigm made it possible to gauge how subjects judgments were influenced by successive ipis. logistic regression revealed a strong primacy effect: subjects decisions were disproportionately influenced by a trials initial ipis. response times and parameter estimates from drift diffusion modeling showed that information accumulates more rapidly with bimodal stimulation than with either unimodal stimulus alone. analysis of error rates within each condition suggested consistently optimal decision making, even with increased ipi variability. finally, beat information delivered by vibrotactile signals proved just as robust as information conveyed by visual signals, confirming vibrotactile stimulations potential as a communication channel.","To test signal robustness, external time domain noise was added to the pulses in a sequence. Finally, we wanted to assess whether designers of signaling devices should consider combining visual and vibrotactile stimuli to optimize information transfer. After all, the human skin, a target for vibrotactile stimulation, is the largest of our sensory receptor surfaces, ~1.7 m2 in average adults .2.1. These results suggest that subjects showed no statistically significant response bias in any of the noise levels, and that they used a decision criterion indistinguishable from one that was statistically optimal . To determine whether subjects used optimal criteria as defined by , we tested the proposition that the error rate for 3 Hz stimuli [Pr(fast | slow stimulus)] and the error rate for 6 Hz stimuli [Pr(slow | fast stimulus)] would be sufficiently similar within each noise level as to be reasonably considered equivalent .3.1. 2.5.1. 31648198 4.1.","To test signal robustness, external time domain noise was added to the pulses in a sequence.

923,"a central bar repeatedly presented in alternation with two flanking bars can lead to the disappearance of the central bar. recently it has been suggested that this masking effect could be explained by object mediated updating: the information from the central bar is integrated into the representation of the flankers, leading not only to the disappearance of the central bar as a separate object, but also to the perception of the flankers in apparent motion between their real position and the position of the central bar. this account suggests that the visibility of the central bar should depend on the same factors as those that influence the construction and maintenance of object representations. therefore separation between central bar and flankers should not influence visibility as long as the time interval between them is adequate to make an interpretation of the scene in terms of one object moving from one location to the other possible location. we found that if the time interval between the central bar and the flankers is neither too short nor too long, the central bar becomes invisible even at large separations. these findings are inconsistent with traditional accounts of the cycling lateral masking displays in terms of local inhibitory mechanisms.","The mask can either precede the target (paracontrast masking) or follow the target (metacontrast masking) in time.
