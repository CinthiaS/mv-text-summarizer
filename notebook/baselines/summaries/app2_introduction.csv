"Thus, a strategy for varying the performance of MAP estimators is still needed. Such a strategy is essential for several reasons: 1) the MAP cost function may be more appropriate in certain classification tasks than the MPM cost function,",PMC3508385.json,"many estimation tasks require bayesian classifiers capable of adjusting their performance (e.g. sensitivity/specificity). in situations where the optimal classification decision can be identified by an exhaustive search over all possible classes, means for adjusting classifier performance, such as probability thresholding or weighting the a posteriori probabilities, are well established. unfortunately, analogous methods compatible with markov random fields (i.e. large collections of dependent random variables) are noticeably absent from the literature. consequently, most markov random field (mrf) based classification systems typically restrict their performance to a single, static operating point (i.e. a paired sensitivity/specificity). to address this deficiency, we previously introduced an extension of maximum posterior marginals (mpm) estimation that allows certain classes to be weighted more heavily than others, thus providing a means for varying classifier performance. however, this extension is not appropriate for the more popular maximum a posteriori (map) estimation. thus, a strategy for varying the performance of map estimators is still needed. such a strategy is essential for several reasons: 1) the map cost function may be more appropriate in certain classification tasks than the mpm cost function, 2) the literature provides a surfeit of map estimation implementations, several of which are considerably faster than the typical markov chain monte carlo methods used for mpm, and 3) map estimation is used far more often than mpm. consequently, in this paper we introduce multiplicative weighted map (mwmap) estimation achieved via the incorporation of multiplicative weights into the map cost function which allows certain classes to be preferred over others. this creates a natural bias for specific classes, and consequently a means for adjusting classifier performance. similarly, we show how this multiplicative weighting strategy can be applied to the mpm cost function (in place of the strategy we presented previously), yielding multiplicative weighted mpm (mwmpm) estimation. furthermore, we describe how mwmap and mwmpm can be implemented using adaptations of current estimation strategies such as iterated conditional modes and mpm monte carlo. to illustrate these implementations, we first integrate them into two separate mrf based classification systems for detecting carcinoma of the prostate (cap) on 1) digitized histological sections from radical prostatectomies and 2) t2 weighted tesla ex vivo prostate mri. to highlight the extensibility of mwmap and mwmpm to estimation tasks involving more than two classes, we also incorporate these estimation criteria into a mrf based classifier used to segment synthetic brain mr images. in the context of these tasks, we show how our novel estimation criteria can be used to arbitrarily adjust the sensitivities of these systems, yielding receiver operator characteristic curves (and surfaces).",0.16595744680851066,0.16239316239316237,0.23796060352330203

"This is an underappreciated ethical challenge to the patient physician relationship: the need for an expansion of the concept of patient autonomy to include, not only decisional autonomy, but also the patients capacity to execute complex self management tasks, i.e., executive autonomy.

When faced with frequent readmissions for chronic disease exacerbations, adverse drug events, acute fluctuations in functional status, and other purported markers of non adherence among otherwise motivated patients, physicians should expand the concept and clinical assessment of patient autonomy to include both autonomous decision making capacity regarding treatment options, decisional autonomy, and autonomous execution of the agreed upon treatment plan, executive autonomy .",PMC2860530.json,"the clinical application of the concept of patient autonomy has centered on the ability to deliberate and make treatment decisions (decisional autonomy) to the virtual exclusion of the capacity to execute the treatment plan (executive autonomy). however, the one component concept of autonomy is problematic in the context of multiple chronic conditions. adherence to complex treatments commonly breaks down when patients have functional, educational, and cognitive barriers that impair their capacity to plan, sequence, and carry out tasks associated with chronic care. the purpose of this article is to call for a two component re conceptualization of autonomy and to argue that the clinical assessment of capacity for patients with chronic conditions should be expanded to include both autonomous decision making and autonomous execution of the agreed upon treatment plan. we explain how the concept of autonomy should be expanded to include both decisional and executive autonomy, describe the biopsychosocial correlates of the two component concept of autonomy, and recommend diagnostic and treatment strategies to support patients with deficits in executive autonomy.",0.5796178343949046,0.3141025641025641,0.45512888998822987

The use of imperfect reference standards (RS) leads to bias in two of the primary goals of psychiatric measurement: prevalence estimation and validation of new screening instruments. LCA is an analytical technique that incorporates information from multiple (usually 3) imperfect measures of a latent (not directly measurable) condition to estimate the prevalence of the latent condition as well as the sensitivity and specificity of each of the imperfect measures .

It is thus critical to understand how the characteristics of patients who make up this unique population relate to the hospice enrollment decision .",PMC2586984.json,"background hospice is felt to be underutilized, particularly among patients with non cancer diagnoses such as stroke. the highest mortality among stroke patients occurs within the first days; however, we know little about the hospice enrollment decision for this population during this critical timeframe. objectives to determine hospice enrollment rates and to describe sociodemographic and clinical predictors of hospice utilization among patients who die within days of their stroke. design retrospective analysis of administrative data. subjects medicare beneficiaries years and older discharged with ischemic stroke from hospitals and metropolitan regions during the year who died within days of their stroke. measures hospice utilization within days. results the overall hospice enrollment rate in our study was 23%. using multivariable logistic regression, factors predicting increased hospice enrollment included older age, female gender, hmo membership, length of stay > days, and dementia. factors predicting decreased enrollment included african american race, mechanical ventilation, gastrostomy tube placement, uncomplicated diabetes mellitus, and valvular disease. when in hospital deaths were excluded, overall enrollment increased to 44%, and mechanical ventilation and dementia ceased to predict enrollment. conclusions hospice enrollment rates among patients who die within the first days of their stroke, particularly among those who survive to discharge, are much higher than prior estimates suggest. although overall enrollment rates were higher than anticipated, there remain important sociodemographic and clinical characteristics unique to this population that predict low hospice utilization which should serve as targets for further research and intervention.",0.35365853658536583,0.1165644171779141,0.2871248512704551
"Echocardiographic measurements of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, LV dilatation, and left atrial (LA) dilatation are predictive of adverse events. Specifically, LV wall thickness, LV mass,, LA diameter,, LA volume, and LVend systolic volume (ESV) are predictive of heart failure (HF) hospitalization and mortality.

"The synthesis and release of renin are the key regulated steps of the renin angiotensin system cascade, which (through the generation of angiotensin II) regulates blood pressure and fluid/electrolyte homeostasis. In adult mammals, the main source of circulating renin is the kidney, where renin is synthesized, stored in granules, and released from juxtaglomerular (JG) cells. In recent years, many advances have been made in understanding the mechanisms that control renin synthesis, renin release, and cell identity.",PMC2861778.json,"renin is the key regulated step in the enzymatic cascade that leads to angiotensin generation and the control of blood pressure and fluid/electrolyte homeostasis. in the adult unstressed animal, renin is synthesized and released by renal juxtaglomerular cells. however, when homeostasis is threatened, the number of cells that express and release renin increases and extends beyond the juxtaglomerular area; the result is an increase in circulating renin and the reestablishment of homeostasis. the increase in the number of renin cells, a process termed recruitment, is achieved by dedifferentiation and re expression of renin in cells derived from the renin lineage. the mechanisms that regulate the related processes of reacquisition of the renin phenotype, renin synthesis, and renin release are beginning to be understood. numerous studies point to camp as a central common factor for the regulation of renin phenotype. in addition, we are seeing the emergence of gap junctions and micrornas as new and promising avenues for a more complete understanding of the complex regulation of the renin cell.",0.4534412955465587,0.19591836734693877,0.3532661718438408
"Yet only recently has IMP been directly compared to muscle force. In that study, it was found that muscle force and IMP were reasonably correlated but that the IMP measurements were much more variable than force measurements with coefficients of variations approaching 100%. Thus, the purpose of this study was to measure the muscle force IMP correlation under conditions of intact skin and fascia to quantify the degree to which IMP serves as a surrogate for active and passive force .",PMC2713015.json,"to determine the degree to which intramuscular pressure (imp) and muscle force are correlated in an intact compartment, a custom pressure transducer was inserted into the rabbit tibialis anterior (ta) while activating the muscle via the peroneal nerve and measuring ta muscle force distal to the ankle retinaculum. in general, imp was more variable compared to muscle force throughout the entire isometric length tension relationship. in contrast to results obtained on isolated ta muscles, imp force relations with the compartment intact were not significantly different between the ascending and descending limbs of the length tension curve. specifically, average relative pressure force coefficients of determination (r2) were 0.760.11 for the active ascending limb and 0.980.01 for the active descending limb. these data demonstrate that muscle force and imp are fairly well correlated under isometric conditions and that this relationship is not improved by measuring imp in an intact environment.",0.43965517241379304,0.13043478260869565,0.2802495123114218

"Hence, the present study focuses on the development of an approach to model fiber and sheet dispersions using an invariant based framework. A previously published orthotropic and invariant based model, which characterizes the nonlinear passive behavior of myocardium , is here augmented with structure parameters allowing the quantification of the degree of dispersion based on measured fiber and sheet angle data.
