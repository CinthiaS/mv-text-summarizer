"The study of the in depth molecular mechanisms regulating this process would be more easily addressed using an in vitro cell culture model. For instance, several binding sites are shared by more than one factor, sometimes with opposite effects: the RAR/RXR binding site stimulates transcription in the presence of its ligand vitamin A and inhibits transcription when bound to vitamin D [, ]. Interestingly, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR) seems to activate renin transcription through sites in both the enhancer and proximal promoter [, ].",PMC2861778.json,"renin is the key regulated step in the enzymatic cascade that leads to angiotensin generation and the control of blood pressure and fluid/electrolyte homeostasis. in the adult unstressed animal, renin is synthesized and released by renal juxtaglomerular cells. however, when homeostasis is threatened, the number of cells that express and release renin increases and extends beyond the juxtaglomerular area; the result is an increase in circulating renin and the reestablishment of homeostasis. the increase in the number of renin cells, a process termed recruitment, is achieved by dedifferentiation and re expression of renin in cells derived from the renin lineage. the mechanisms that regulate the related processes of reacquisition of the renin phenotype, renin synthesis, and renin release are beginning to be understood. numerous studies point to camp as a central common factor for the regulation of renin phenotype. in addition, we are seeing the emergence of gap junctions and micrornas as new and promising avenues for a more complete understanding of the complex regulation of the renin cell.",0.2371541501976285,0.015936254980079684,0.1893684429868232
"The protocol was approved by the Department of Veterans Affairs, San Diego Committee on the Use of Animal Subjects in Research. Briefly, rabbits were anesthetized with 5% isoflurane and a subcutaneous injection of a ketamine xylazine cocktail (50 and 5 mg/kg body mass, respectively) and maintained on 2% isoflurane anesthesia. Heart rate and oxygen saturation were monitored (VetOx, Heska Co., Fort Collins, CO) throughout the test duration, and anesthesia level was adjusted as needed.",PMC2713015.json,"to determine the degree to which intramuscular pressure (imp) and muscle force are correlated in an intact compartment, a custom pressure transducer was inserted into the rabbit tibialis anterior (ta) while activating the muscle via the peroneal nerve and measuring ta muscle force distal to the ankle retinaculum. in general, imp was more variable compared to muscle force throughout the entire isometric length tension relationship. in contrast to results obtained on isolated ta muscles, imp force relations with the compartment intact were not significantly different between the ascending and descending limbs of the length tension curve. specifically, average relative pressure force coefficients of determination (r2) were 0.760.11 for the active ascending limb and 0.980.01 for the active descending limb. these data demonstrate that muscle force and imp are fairly well correlated under isometric conditions and that this relationship is not improved by measuring imp in an intact environment.",0.1938325991189427,0.008888888888888889,0.1441797242192102
"Thus, we hypothesized that CDB4124 could induce LSM cell apoptosis through down regulation of Bcl 2 expression. To test this possibility, the effects of CDB4124 on Bcl 2 mRNA expression in primary LSM and MSM cells were assessed by real time PCR at 24 or 48 h; and the effects on Bcl 2 protein expression were measured by western blot analysis at 72 h.

"To appropriately account for the bimodal distribution of orientations, higher spatial resolutions would be required than those commonly used within FE studies, including this study. That is, the orthotropy in the propagation of the action potential in the LV model was governed by the mean orientation of the fibers and the sheets. However, the chosen activation sequence, which approximates a normal beat where the entire endocardium is activated almost simultaneously, leads to a strongly transmural activation where effects of electrical orthotropy are strongly attenuated.",PMC3970090.json,"summary we present an approach to model the dispersion of fiber and sheet orientations in the myocardium. by utilizing structure parameters, an existing orthotropic and invariant based constitutive model developed to describe the passive behavior of the myocardium is augmented. two dispersion parameters are fitted to experimentally observed angular dispersion data of the myocardial tissue. computations are performed on a unit myocardium tissue cube and on a slice of the left ventricle indicating that the dispersion parameter has an effect on the myocardial deformation and stress development. the use of fiber dispersions relating to a pathological myocardium had a rather big effect. the final example represents an ellipsoidal model of the left ventricle indicating the influence of fiber and sheet dispersions upon contraction over a cardiac cycle. although only a minor shift in the pressurevolume (pv) loops between the cases with no dispersions and with fiber and sheet dispersions for a healthy myocardium was observed, a remarkably different behavior is obtained with a fiber dispersion relating to a diseased myocardium. in future simulations, this dispersion model for myocardial tissue may advantageously be used together with models of, for example, growth and remodeling of various cardiac diseases.",0.2571428571428572,0.043165467625899276,0.20818006345766507
"Regardless of study type, increased severity of CKD appears universally associated with greater awareness of disease status (, , , , ), providing some face validity to the measures of awareness used; presence of proteinuria was also associated with greater awareness , perhaps due to increased symptoms in these individuals. However, presence of CKD symptoms has not been explored as a predictor of CKD awareness, nor has total number or severity of comorbid conditions. Health literacy is just beginning to be explored in CKD but does appear to be positively associated with understanding of personal CKD risk ; health numeracy , which describes an individuals ability to understand numbers as they relate to health (e.g., interpretation of test results, calculation of dosages, and understanding of dietary portions and nutrients), is likely to be quite important in CKD awareness and self management but remains unexplored.",PMC2864779.json,"earlier recognition of chronic kidney disease (ckd) could slow progression, prevent complications, and reduce cardiovascular related outcomes. however, current estimates of ckd awareness indicate that both patient and provider level awareness remain unacceptably low. many of the factors that are possibly associated with ckd awareness, which could help guide implementation of awareness efforts, have yet to be fully examined. also, little is known regarding whether increased patient or provider awareness improves clinical outcomes or whether there are possible negative consequences of awareness for ckd patients. further research is necessary to continue to design and refine awareness campaigns aimed at both patients and providers, but there is an immediate need for dissemination of basic ckd information, given both the high prevalence of ckd and its risk factors and the low estimated awareness of ckd.",0.31851851851851853,0.06716417910447761,0.23708523819514127
