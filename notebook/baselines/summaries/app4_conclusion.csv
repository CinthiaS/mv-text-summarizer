While our study is based on histological specimens removed at the time of surgery after a final pathological diagnosis had been determined, our findings agree with the findings of three other recent studies, which together identified no cases of an occult appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinoma in a grossly normal appendix out of 476 appendectomies performed at the time of surgery for a mucinous ovarian neoplasm [].",PMC3929430.json,"background due to concern that mucinous malignant or borderline ovarian neoplasms (mon) may represent metastatic deposits from appendiceal primaries, gynecologic oncologists routinely perform appendectomy in these cases. however, a multidisciplinary critique of this practice is lacking. methods the new england case control study database was utilized to compare the effect of prior appendectomy against known risk factors for mon. pathology and operative reports of local cases of mon were reviewed to estimate the frequency of microscopic mucinous lesions in the appendix. protein expression patterns among mucinous ovarian, colorectal, and appendiceal cancers were compared by immunohistochemistry. results from the new england case control study, cases of mon were compared against 2,339 age matched controls. prior appendectomy did not reduce the risk of mon (or 1.28, 95% ci 0.831.92, p=0.23), while prior tubal ligation, parity, and breastfeeding were each protective against mon. active smoking (or 2.04, 95% ci 1.482.80, p<0.001) was associated with an increased risk of mon. among mucinous adnexal tumors, appendectomy did not reclassify any mon as appendiceal in origin. by immunohistochemistry, mucinous ovarian carcinomas tended to be ck7+/ck20 /muc2 /cdx2 , whereas mucinous colorectal and appendiceal adenocarcinomas were typically ck7 /ck20+/muc2+/cdx2+, although with some overlap in immunophenotype. additionally, pax8 was positive in a subset of moc and negative in all appendiceal carcinomas. conclusion prior appendectomy is not protective against development of malignant or borderline mon. routine appendectomy during surgery for mon seldom reveals an unsuspected gi primary in early stage tumors but may aid in final diagnosis in advanced stage cases.",0.31313131313131315,0.05076142131979696,0.2207799569741402

A syngeneic mouse model of MM that recapitulates human disease was used to evaluate the role of estrogen in MM progression.,PMC6608706.json,"although the role of estrogen in solid cancers has been widely investigated, its effect in hematologic malignancies including multiple myeloma (mm) is not known. here, we utilized a syngeneic mouse model of mm to address this question. in this model, treatment with 17 estradiol significantly promoted progression of the disease. this effect has not been attributed to the direct effect of estrogen on mm cells but rather was mediated through estrogen induced alterations in tumor microenvironment. in mm bone marrow, myeloid derived suppressor cells (mdscs) represent one of the major cellular populations. 17 estradiol did not promote expansion and accumulation of mdscs. however, it significantly increased their ability to suppress t cells proliferation. thus, these data demonstrated that estrogen promotes progression of mm by enhancing an immunosuppressive function of the bone marrow mdscs.",0.3369565217391304,0.16483516483516483,0.27255171585154725

"In conclusion, using in situ AFM, we find that the magnitude of the inhibition of COM step growth by the aspartic acid rich peptide (D3S)7D3 depends on the exposure time of the terraces to the surrounding solution. To interpret these results, we developed a time dependent step pinning model in which average impurity spacing depends on the terrace lifetime as given by the ratio of step spacing to step speed. Application of this model to the measured variation in step speed shows that the experimental results are well described by the model.",PMC2934911.json,"using in situ atomic force microscopy (afm), we investigate the inhibition of calcium oxalate monohydrate (com) step growth by aspartic acid rich peptides and find that the magnitude of the effect depends on terrace lifetime. we then derive a time dependent step pinning model in which average impurity spacing depends on the terrace lifetime as given by the ratio of step spacing to step speed. we show that the measured variation in step speed is well fit by the model and allows us to extract the characteristic peptide adsorption time. the model also predicts that a crossover in the timescales for impurity adsorption and terrace exposure leads to bistable growth dynamics described mathematically by a catastrophe. we observe this behavior experimentally both through the sudden drop in step speed to zero upon decrease of supersaturation as well as through fluctuations in step speed between the two limiting values at the point where the catastrophe occurs. we discuss the models general applicability to macromolecular modifiers and biomineral phases.",0.623076923076923,0.40310077519379844,0.5280398796636434

The results indicated that the ncMRI magnitude and phase signals evoked by physiological stimulation are too weak to be detected in human subjects.",PMC3097305.json,"up to date, no consensus has been achieved regarding the possibility of detecting neuronal currents by mri (ncmri) in human brain. to evaluate the detectability of ncmri, an effective way is to simulate ncmri signal with the realistic neuronal geometry and electrophysiological processes. unfortunately, previous realistic ncmri models are based on rat and monkey neurons. the species difference in neuronal morphology and physiology would prevent these models from simulating the ncmri signal accurately in human subjects. the aim of the present study is to bridge this gap by establishing a realistic ncmri model specifically for human cerebral cortex. in this model, the ncmri signal was simulated using anatomically reconstructed human pyramidal neurons and their biophysical properties. the modeling results showed that the amplitude of ncmri signal significantly depends on the density of synchronously firing neurons and imaging conditions such as position of imaging voxel, direction of main magnetic field (b0) relative to the cortical surface and echo time. the results indicated that physiologically evoked ncmri signal is too weak to be detected (magnitude/phase change 1.4106/0.02), but the phase signal induced by spontaneous activity may reach a detectable level (up to 0.2) in favorable conditions.",0.45652173913043476,0.2554744525547445,0.3913039896192415

We therefore recommend changing the default paradigm for pediatric research so as to better respect childrens rights to have their care guided by the same high quality evidence as adults presently have .",PMC2903616.json,"objective randomized clinical trials of novel critical care interventions are currently tested in children only after documenting their safety in adults. although this practice may protect children from research risks, it may paradoxically threaten childrens well being by depriving them of evidence to guide their care. we sought to evaluate the ethical, methodologic, and practical arguments for and against studying critical care interventions in adults and children simultaneously rather than sequentially. data source empirical studies and conceptual arguments germane to the objective were reviewed. data extraction and synthesis children are traditionally viewed as participants of last resort due to their vulnerability and decisional incapacity. however, critically ill adults commonly share similar features. thus, structured risk assessments used by institutional review boards to determine the adequacy of research protections for critically ill adults can also help protect children. from a methodologic perspective, interventions may be tested simultaneously in children and adults by enrolling children as a prespecified subgroup within a larger adult randomized clinical trial or by enrolling children in a separate trial conducted in parallel. both approaches raise practical and analytical challenges that can frequently be met. for example, investigators might choose outcome measures that are appropriate for both adults and children. additionally, using bayesian approaches to link the estimates of treatment effects in children to the values observed in adults may enhance the statistical power to detect pediatric specific effects. finally, centralized institutional review boards and data monitoring centers may alleviate practical concerns with conducting trials among adults and children simultaneously. conclusions the current standard of testing critical care interventions in adults before children rests on tenuous ethical arguments and is entrenched by the methodologic and logistic barriers encountered with alternative approaches. however, these barriers will frequently be surmountable. we therefore propose that the default paradigm be changed such that interventions are examined routinely in critically ill children and adults simultaneously unless unique reasons exist to the contrary.",0.2673267326732673,0.0746268656716418,0.19177064519394535

The osmotic mapping technique proposed herein allows local variations in K to be determined by combining nano and microindentation instrumentation with macroscopic osmotic swelling pressure observations.",PMC2804954.json,"polymer gels undergo volume phase transition in a thermodynamically poor solvent as a result of changes in molecular interactions. the osmotic pressure of gels, both synthetic and biological in nature, induces swelling and imparts the materials with the capacity to resist compressive loads. we have investigated the mechanical and swelling properties of poly(vinyl alcohol) (pva) gels brought into the unstable state by changing the composition of the solvent. chemically crosslinked pva gels were prepared and initially swollen in water at c and then n propyl alcohol (non solvent) was gradually added to the equilibrium liquid. afm imaging and force indentation measurements were made in water/n propyl alcohol mixtures of different composition. it has been found that the elastic modulus of the gels exhibits simple scaling behavior as a function of the polymer concentration in each solvent mixture over the entire concentration range investigated. the power law exponent n obtained for the concentration dependence of the shear modulus increases from 2.3 (in pure water) to 7.4 (in 35% (v/v) water + 65% (v/v) n propyl alcohol mixture). in the vicinity of the theta solvent composition (59% (v/v) water + 41% (v/v) n propyl alcohol) n 2.9. shear and osmotic modulus maps of the phase separating gels have been constructed. it is demonstrated that the latter sensitively reflects the changes both in the topography and thermodynamic interactions occurring in the course of volume phase transition.",0.30120481927710846,0.07272727272727272,0.20248863596145172
"This study demonstrates hypermethylation of two CpG dinucleotide sites in the OPRM1 promoter region in former heroin addicts. Hypermethylation of the 18 and the +204 CpG sites in the former heroin addicts is likely to reduce OPRM1 gene expression since DNA hypermethylation has been shown in other studies to reduce gene expression. When hypermethylated, transcription factor binding sites have reduced binding affinity for their cognate transcription factors.",PMC2778040.json,"the opioid receptor is the site of action of opiates and opioids. we examined whether there are differences in cpg dinucleotide methylation in the oprm1 promoter between former heroin addicts and controls. we analyzed methylation at sixteen cpg dinucleotides in dna obtained from lymphocytes of caucasian former severe heroin addicts stabilized in methadone maintenance treatment and caucasian control subjects. direct sequencing of bisulfite treated dna showed that the percent methylation at two cpg sites was significantly associated with heroin addiction. the level of methylation at the cpg site was 25.4% in the stabilized methadone maintained former heroin addicts and 21.4% in controls (p = 0.0035, generalized estimating equations (gee); p = 0.0077, t test; false discovery rate (fdr) = 0.048), and the level of methylation at the +84 cpg dinucleotide site was 7.4% in cases and 5.6% in controls (p = 0.0095, gee; p = 0.0067, t test; fdr = 0.080). both the and the +84 cpg sites are located in potential sp1 transcription factor binding sites. methylation of these cpg sites may lead to reduced oprm1 expression in the lymphocytes of these former heroin addicts.",0.2801556420233463,0.1411764705882353,0.2771569988472925
"In the past few years, major advances in the understanding of the mechanisms that control renin synthesis have been achieved largely through the availability of renin expressing tumoral cell lines, fluorescence marked renal arteriolar smooth muscle cells from the renin lineage, and transgenic mouse models, including a knock in of cre recombinase in the renin locus. We expect that in the near future, experiments using these and new models will definitely accelerate the pace of discovery in this field . In summary, renin cell identity, renin synthesis, and renin release depend on multiple events centrally regulated by cAMP at the transcriptional and post transcriptional levels.",PMC2861778.json,"renin is the key regulated step in the enzymatic cascade that leads to angiotensin generation and the control of blood pressure and fluid/electrolyte homeostasis. in the adult unstressed animal, renin is synthesized and released by renal juxtaglomerular cells. however, when homeostasis is threatened, the number of cells that express and release renin increases and extends beyond the juxtaglomerular area; the result is an increase in circulating renin and the reestablishment of homeostasis. the increase in the number of renin cells, a process termed recruitment, is achieved by dedifferentiation and re expression of renin in cells derived from the renin lineage. the mechanisms that regulate the related processes of reacquisition of the renin phenotype, renin synthesis, and renin release are beginning to be understood. numerous studies point to camp as a central common factor for the regulation of renin phenotype. in addition, we are seeing the emergence of gap junctions and micrornas as new and promising avenues for a more complete understanding of the complex regulation of the renin cell.",0.3868613138686131,0.125,0.2910558923997712
"The raw intramuscular pressure time traces mimicked the general shape of the raw isometric force time traces but exhibited a drop in pressure over the course of activation as previously reported. As expected, the muscle length isometric tension curve was characterized by an ascending limb at lengths less than L0 and a descending limb with passive tension rising exponentially at lengths greater than L0 .

"There are several reports in the literature, which provide evidence for the presence of dispersion in the fiber and sheet orientations in myocardial tissues. Under healthy conditions, dispersion is rather mild, but under certain pathologies such as HCM [, , ], dispersion can be quite pronounced. In the vast majority of modeling studies, however, dispersion and its influence upon the mechanical response of the myocardium has been largely ignored.",PMC3970090.json,"summary we present an approach to model the dispersion of fiber and sheet orientations in the myocardium. by utilizing structure parameters, an existing orthotropic and invariant based constitutive model developed to describe the passive behavior of the myocardium is augmented. two dispersion parameters are fitted to experimentally observed angular dispersion data of the myocardial tissue. computations are performed on a unit myocardium tissue cube and on a slice of the left ventricle indicating that the dispersion parameter has an effect on the myocardial deformation and stress development. the use of fiber dispersions relating to a pathological myocardium had a rather big effect. the final example represents an ellipsoidal model of the left ventricle indicating the influence of fiber and sheet dispersions upon contraction over a cardiac cycle. although only a minor shift in the pressurevolume (pv) loops between the cases with no dispersions and with fiber and sheet dispersions for a healthy myocardium was observed, a remarkably different behavior is obtained with a fiber dispersion relating to a diseased myocardium. in future simulations, this dispersion model for myocardial tissue may advantageously be used together with models of, for example, growth and remodeling of various cardiac diseases.",0.25954198473282447,0.07692307692307693,0.20378215094362293
