Accounts of chemical research",PMC3217083.json,"conspectus nanoparticles conjugated with functional ligands are expected to have a major impact in medicine, photonics, sensing, and nanoarchitecture design. one major obstacle to realizing the promise of these materials, however, is the difficulty in controlling the ligand/nanoparticle ratio. this obstacle can be segmented into three key areas: first, many system designs have failed to account for the true heterogeneity of ligand/nanoparticle ratios that compose each material. second, the field's accepted level of characterization of ligand nanoparticle materials is deficient as it does not provide an accurate definition of material composition that is necessary to both understand the material property relationships as well as to monitor the consistency of the material. in particular, many characterization assays only determine the mean ligand/nanoparticle ratio and do not provide the number and relative amount of the different ligand/nanoparticle ratios that compose a material. third, some synthetic approaches that are presently in use may not produce consistent material as they are sensitive to reaction kinetics, and the synthetic history of the nanoparticle. in this account we describe the recent advances that we have made in understanding the material composition of ligand nanoparticle systems. our work has been enabled by a model system using poly(amidoamine) dendrimers and two small molecule ligands. using reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography (hplc) we have successfully resolved and quantified the relative amount of each ligand/dendrimer ratio present. this type of information is rare for the entire field of ligand nanoparticle materials because most analytical techniques have been unable to identify the components in the distribution. our experimental data indicates that the actual distribution of ligand nanoparticle components is much more heterogeneous than commonly assumed. the mean ligand/nanoparticle ratio that is so often the only information known about a material is insufficient. this is because the mean does not provide information on the diversity of components in the material and often does not describe the most common component (the mode). additionally, our experimental data has provided examples of material batches with the same mean ligand/nanoparticle ratio and very different distributions. this discrepancy indicates that the mean cannot be used as the sole metric to assess the reproducibility of a system. we further found that distribution profiles can be highly sensitive to the synthetic history of the starting material as well as slight changes in reaction conditions. we have incorporated the lessons from our experimental data into new systems designs to provide improved control over the ligand/nanoparticle ratios.",0.14254859611231102,0.04772234273318872,0.14862000412708132

"Although our results cannot rule out any of these costs, previous analyses have shown little to no role for amino acid cost or polypeptide length, the major correlates of synthesis and degradation cost, in shaping evolutionary rate variation . If the loss of functional molecules imposes the dominant fitness cost, essential genes determined by systematic deletion studies should evolve much more slowly than dispensable genes, because deletions result in the loss of all functional molecules.

involvement of the ventral pallidum (vp) in cocaine seeking behavior, in contrast with considerable documentation of the involvement of its major afferent, the nucleus accumbens, over the past thirty years utilizing electrophysiology, lesion, inactivation, molecular, imaging, and other approaches. the vp is neuroanatomically positioned to integrate signals projected from the nucleus accumbens, basolateral amygdala, and ventral tegmental area. in turn, vp projects to thalamoprefrontal, subthalamic, and mesencephalic dopamine regions having widespread influence across mesolimbic, mesocortical, and nigrostriatal systems. prior lesion studies have implicated vp in cocaine seeking behavior, but the electrophysiological mechanisms underlying this behavior in the vp have not been investigated. in the present investigation, following two weeks of training over which animals increased drug intake, vp phasic activity comprised rapid phasic increases or decreases in firing rate during the seconds prior to and/or following cocaine reinforced responses, similar to those found in accumbens. as a population, the direction (increasing or decreasing) and magnitude of firing rate changes were normally distributed suggesting that ventral striatopallidal processing is heterogeneous. since changes in firing rate around the self administering lever press occurred in animals that escalated drug intake prior to neuronal recordings, a marker of addiction like behavior in the rat, the present experiment provides novel support for a role of vp in drug seeking behavior. this is especially important given that pallidothalamic and pallidomesencephalic vp projections are positioned to alter dopaminoceptive targets such as the medial prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, and dorsal striatum, all of which have roles in cocaine self administration.",0.24666666666666665,0.07345575959933222,0.17310446283897865

encodes a member of the irf family of transcription factors. mutations in irf6 cause van der woude (vws) and popliteal pterygium syndromes (pps), two related orofacial clefting disorders. here, we compared and contrasted the frequency and distribution of exonic mutations in irf6 between two large geographically distinct collections of families with vws and between one collection of families with pps. methods we performed direct sequence analysis of irf6 exons on samples from three collections, two with vws and one with pps. results we identified mutations in irf6 exons in 68% of families in both vws collections and in 97% of families with pps. in sum, novel disease causing variants were found. the distribution of mutations in the irf6 exons in each collection was not random; exons 3, 4, 7, and accounted for 80%. in the vws collections, the mutations were evenly divided between protein truncation and missense, whereas most mutations identified in the pps collection were missense. further, the missense mutations associated with pps were localized significantly to exon 4, at residues that are predicted to bind directly to dna. conclusion the non random distribution of mutations in the irf6 exons suggests a two tier approach for efficient mutation screens for irf6. the type and distribution of mutations are consistent with the hypothesis that vws is caused by haploinsufficiency of irf6. on the other hand, the distribution of pps associated mutations suggests a different, though not mutually exclusive, effect on irf6

series of transgenic mice designed for expression of human alr2 (akr1b1) in epithelial and outer cortical fiber cells of the lens. one of the founder lines, designated par39, developed an early onset cataract that involved formation of a plaque of cells at the anterior aspect of the lens. these cells appear to separate from the anterior epithelium and undergo a dramatic change that is reminiscent of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (emt). we characterized this phenotype in the par39 strain by examining rates of cell proliferation and by immunostaining for markers of emt. incorporation of the thymidine analog bromodeoxyuridine (brdu) was used to estimate cell proliferation in two functional areas of the lens epithelium: the mitotically active germinative zone (gz) and the less proliferative center zone (cz). staining cell nuclei with diamido 4',6 diamidino 2 phenylindole (dapi) was used to establish a total cell count in the demarcated areas. lens epithelium in par39

observed in the cz (0.6% compared to 3.3%). however, cell density was greater within the gz of par39 mice as compared with nontransgenic controls, while it was not significantly different in the cz among the two groups. furthermore, cells associated with the epithelial plaque did not stain positive for brdu, but were strongly positive for alpha smooth muscle actin, a classical marker for emt. these findings suggest that alr2 over expression is associated with an alteration in the balance between proliferation and apoptosis of epithelial cells in the mouse lens, and that cells associated
