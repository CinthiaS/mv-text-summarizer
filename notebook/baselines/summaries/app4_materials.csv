MITOCHONDRIAL FATTY ACID OXIDATION DISORDERS: PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL STUDIES IN MOUSE MODELS 20532823 Energy deficiency due to impaired long chain fatty acid oxidation especially affects high energetic organs such as the heart or skeletal muscle. Disease episodes occur in situations of increased energy demand such as exercise or illnesses when energy from carbohydrates has been used up and fatty acid oxidation is activated to provide energy from fat.

The entire field of polymers, for example, has confronted this challenge for more than a century.",PMC3217083.json,"conspectus nanoparticles conjugated with functional ligands are expected to have a major impact in medicine, photonics, sensing, and nanoarchitecture design. one major obstacle to realizing the promise of these materials, however, is the difficulty in controlling the ligand/nanoparticle ratio. this obstacle can be segmented into three key areas: first, many system designs have failed to account for the true heterogeneity of ligand/nanoparticle ratios that compose each material. second, the field's accepted level of characterization of ligand nanoparticle materials is deficient as it does not provide an accurate definition of material composition that is necessary to both understand the material property relationships as well as to monitor the consistency of the material. in particular, many characterization assays only determine the mean ligand/nanoparticle ratio and do not provide the number and relative amount of the different ligand/nanoparticle ratios that compose a material. third, some synthetic approaches that are presently in use may not produce consistent material as they are sensitive to reaction kinetics, and the synthetic history of the nanoparticle. in this account we describe the recent advances that we have made in understanding the material composition of ligand nanoparticle systems. our work has been enabled by a model system using poly(amidoamine) dendrimers and two small molecule ligands. using reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography (hplc) we have successfully resolved and quantified the relative amount of each ligand/dendrimer ratio present. this type of information is rare for the entire field of ligand nanoparticle materials because most analytical techniques have been unable to identify the components in the distribution. our experimental data indicates that the actual distribution of ligand nanoparticle components is much more heterogeneous than commonly assumed. the mean ligand/nanoparticle ratio that is so often the only information known about a material is insufficient. this is because the mean does not provide information on the diversity of components in the material and often does not describe the most common component (the mode). additionally, our experimental data has provided examples of material batches with the same mean ligand/nanoparticle ratio and very different distributions. this discrepancy indicates that the mean cannot be used as the sole metric to assess the reproducibility of a system. we further found that distribution profiles can be highly sensitive to the synthetic history of the starting material as well as slight changes in reaction conditions. we have incorporated the lessons from our experimental data into new systems designs to provide improved control over the ligand/nanoparticle ratios.",0.21906693711967548,0.0570264765784114,0.17462667849909796

We only briefly describe the technique here.,PMC2978811.json,"summary serial block face imaging is a microscopy technique in which the top of a specimen is cut or ground away and a mosaic of images is collected of the newly revealed cross section. images collected from each slice are then digitally stacked to achieve three dimensional images. the development of fully automated image acquisition devices has made serial block face imaging more attractive by greatly reducing labor requirements. the technique is particularly attractive for studies of biological activity within cancellous bone as it has the capability of achieving direct, automated measures of biological and morphological traits and their associations with one another. when used with fluorescence microscopy, serial block face imaging has the potential to achieve 3d images of tissue as well as fluorescent markers of biological activity. epifluorescence based serial block face imaging presents a number of unique challenges for visualizing bone specimens due to noise generated by subsurface signal and local variations in tissue autofluorescence. here we present techniques for processing serial block face images of trabecular bone using a combination of non uniform illumination correction, precise tiling of the mosaic in each cross section, cross section alignment for vertical stacking, removal of subsurface signal, and segmentation. the resulting techniques allow examination of bone surface texture that will enable 3d quantitative measures of biological processes in cancellous bone biopsies.",0.29268292682926833,0.11228070175438597,0.22242886620752683

Three of these were custom designed CCD based detectors of different sensitivities, referred to as the micro angiographic fluoroscopic detector (MAF), the high sensitivity micro angiographic fluoroscopic detector (HSMAF) and the micro angiographic detector (MA). The key differences between the three detectors are in their CCD camera coupling arrangements (direct fiber optic coupling in the MA and the HSMAF versus mirror lens coupling in the MAF) and whether there is an additional gain stage (no additional gain in the MA versus an added variable gain dual stage micro channel plate (MCP) light image intensifier (LII) in the MAF and the HSMAF).",PMC2562256.json,"the performance of high sensitivity x ray imagers may be limited by additive instrumentation noise rather than by quantum noise when operated at the low exposure rates used in fluoroscopic procedures. the equipment invasive instrumentation noise measures (in terms of electrons) are generally difficult to make and are potentially not as helpful in clinical practice as would be a direct radiological representation of such noise that may be determined in the field. in this work, we define a clinically relevant representation for instrumentation noise in terms of noise equivalent detector entrance exposure, termed the instrumentation noise equivalent exposure (inee), which can be determined through experimental measurements of noise variance or signal to noise ratio (snr). the inee was measured for various detectors, thus demonstrating its usefulness in terms of providing information about the effective operating range of the various detectors. a simulation study is presented to demonstrate the robustness of this metric against post processing, and its dependence on inherent detector blur. these studies suggest that the inee may be a practical gauge to determine and compare the range of quantum limited performance for clinical x ray detectors of different design, with the implication that detector performance at exposures below the inee will be instrumentation noise limited rather than quantum noise limited.",0.3413173652694611,0.054216867469879526,0.1926369726202316

"Memory strength and variance was assessed by plotting the hit rate against the false alarm rate as a function of response confidence and analyzing the resulting receiver operating characteristics (ROCs) using signal detection theory (for review see ). When the ROC is plotted on z coordinates, the intercept of the z ROC provides a rough index of recognition memory strength or sensitivity, such that a higher intercept reflects better sensitivity. Moreover, the slope of the z ROC provides a measure of the relative variance of the old and new items (i.e., snew/sold).",PMC2970752.json,"it is well established that the memory strength of studied items is more variable than the strength of new items on tests of recognition memory, but the reason why this occurs is poorly understood. one account for this old item variance effect is based on single process theory, which proposes that this effect is due to variability in how well items are initially encoded into memory (i.e., the encoding variability account). in contrast, dual process theory argues that old items are more variable because they are influenced by both recollection and familiarity, whereas recognition of new items relies primarily on familiarity. the current study shows that increasing encoding variability did not increase old item variance, and that old item variance is directly related to the contribution of recollection. these results indicate that old item memory variability is due to the relative contribution of recollection and familiarity.",0.30833333333333335,0.05042016806722689,0.21603453557163887
"19191548 Based on the structural and binding data, it is clearly evident that actinonin binds to PDFEc in a competitive manner with a 1:1 stoichiometry of actinonin to the enzyme (refer to ). As two independent binding sites were observed in our calorimetric titration experiments, it appeared plausible that the origin of these sites was based on the enzyme population containing two types of metal ions. Should this be the case, the removal of the active site Ni2+ would result in the loss of one of the binding phases (corresponding to PDFEc Ni2+) while leaving the phase associated with PDFEc Zn2+ (since it is considered nearly impossible to remove bound Zn2+).",PMC2644421.json,"we investigated the binding of a naturally occurring antibiotic, actinonin, to the ni2+ reconstituted recombinant form of e. coli peptide deformylase (pdfec) via isothermal titration microcalorimetry. the binding data conformed to both exothermic and endothermic phases with magnitudes of g, h, and ts being equal to 12, 2.7, and 9.3, and 8.7, 3.9, and 12.6 kcal/mol, respectively. evidently, although both phases are dominated by favorable entropic changes, the exothermic phase has about 6.7 kcal/mol enthalpic advantage over the endothermic phase. we observed that the removal of bound ni2+ from pdfec abolished the exothermic phase without affecting the endothermic phase, but it was regained upon addition of zn2+. in conjunction with metal analysis data, we propose that the recombinant form of pdfec is expressed in two stable conformational states that yield markedly distinct itc profiles (i.e., exothermic versus endothermic) upon interaction with actinonin. the existence of two conformational states of pdfec is further supported by the observation of two distinct and independent transitions during the thermal unfolding of the enzyme. in addition, the thermodynamic data reveals that the formation of the pdfec actinonin complex results in the transfer of one h+ from the enzyme phase to the bulk solvent at ph 6.3. both exothermic and endothermic phases produce highly negative cp values, but there is no apparent enthalpy entropy compensation effect upon formation of the pdfec actinonin complex. in view of the known structural features of the enzyme, arguments are presented that the alternative conformational states of pdfec are modulated by the metal ligation at the enzyme site.",0.328042328042328,0.07446808510638298,0.23645373536254594

"There are two hormonal systems that are widely recognized to influence reproductive behaviors, including acoustic communication, in anurans. The first is a neuromodulator system comprised of arginine vasotocin (AVT), a peptide hormone produced by neurons in the telencephalon and diencephalon. The second is an endocrine system consisting of the suite of steroid hormones (e.g., testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, estrogen) produced by the gonads and regulated by a signaling cascade beginning with another neuropeptide produced in the basal forebrain, gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH).",PMC2722832.json,"the majority of anuran amphibians (frogs and toads) use acoustic communication to mediate sexual behavior and reproduction. generally, females find and select their mates using acoustic cues provided by males in the form of conspicuous advertisement calls. in these species, vocal signal production and reception are intimately tied to successful reproduction. research with anurans has demonstrated that acoustic communication is modulated by reproductive hormones, including gonadal steroids and peptide neuromodulators. most of these studies have focused on the ways in which hormonal systems influence vocal signal production; however, here we will concentrate on a growing body of literature that examines hormonal modulation of call reception. this literature suggests that reproductive hormones contribute to the coordination of reproductive behaviors between signaler and receiver by modulating sensitivity and spectral filtering of the anuran auditory system. it has become evident that the hormonal systems that influence reproductive behaviors are highly conserved among vertebrate taxa, thus studying the endocrine and neuromodulatory bases of acoustic communication in frogs and toads can lead to insights of broader applicability to hormonal modulation of vertebrate sensory physiology and behavior.",0.33587786259541985,0.061538461538461535,0.21103798621172393
"Because the chicks in this study were kept in darkness for much of the time, we need to discuss whether the darkness vitiates our results.

We conclude that the addition of bupivacaine or silver sulfadiazine to sIPN does not affect healing of partial thickness wounds in our animal model compared to sIPN alone.",PMC2924184.json,"introduction previously, we have shown in a cross comparison study that multifunctional photopolymerized semi interpenetrating network (sipn) system is an effective donor site treatment in a swine model. the advantages of sipn include spray on application, in situ photopolymerization, and ability to cover large contoured areas. sipn has also been shown to be an effective delivery vehicle for keratinocyte growth factor, dexamethasone, bupivacaine, and silver sulfadiazine in vitro. our aim for this study was to show that these products delivered to the wound bed with sipn would not change the wound healing characteristics compared to the control site through qualitative clinical evaluation and to compare the rate and quality of donor site healing through histologic evaluation. methods eight yucatan swine of 40lbs each were randomly divided into four groups of two pigs prior to surgery. each animal had 5.6 % total body surface area of skin harvested from two different dorsal regions, with one at 22/1000th inch and the other at 30/1000th inch setting on the dermatome. each test site on each animal was then sequentially dressed with cm2 of xeroform gauze, sipn, sipn loaded with 0.5% bupivacaine, or sipn loaded with 1% silver sulfadiazine. sipn with or without soluble drugs were applied as liquid then photopolymerized in situ to form an elastic covering. each of the test areas was separated by cm2 of autograft which was used to divide the test areas. wound assessment and euthanasia occurred at days 7, 9, 14, and days. a full thickness biopsy was taken from each of the study areas for histological analysis. results by days, all areas show complete epidermal coverage histologically. the 30/1000th inch site revealed a thicker, more irregular dermis compared to the 22/1000th site. evaluation of the day sites revealed equal thinning and flattening of the new epidermis. no site showed full restoration of the rete ridges. no signs of infection were seen in clinical or histological evaluations of any treatment. conclusion the addition of bupivacaine and silver sulfadiazine to sipn does not show any alterations in wound healing of a donor site in a swine model when compared with sipn without loaded drugs and a standard control dressing. this efficacy may be coupled with established localized sipn drug delivery profiles and allow further studies to evaluate the efficacy of these drugs to promote healing, eradicate and prevent infection, and manage pain.",0.27586206896551724,0.13034623217922606,0.2495584332759906

First, doing so could reduce overall research costs by enabling investigators to use the same data collection and management infrastructures for each subgroup.",PMC2903616.json,"objective randomized clinical trials of novel critical care interventions are currently tested in children only after documenting their safety in adults. although this practice may protect children from research risks, it may paradoxically threaten childrens well being by depriving them of evidence to guide their care. we sought to evaluate the ethical, methodologic, and practical arguments for and against studying critical care interventions in adults and children simultaneously rather than sequentially. data source empirical studies and conceptual arguments germane to the objective were reviewed. data extraction and synthesis children are traditionally viewed as participants of last resort due to their vulnerability and decisional incapacity. however, critically ill adults commonly share similar features. thus, structured risk assessments used by institutional review boards to determine the adequacy of research protections for critically ill adults can also help protect children. from a methodologic perspective, interventions may be tested simultaneously in children and adults by enrolling children as a prespecified subgroup within a larger adult randomized clinical trial or by enrolling children in a separate trial conducted in parallel. both approaches raise practical and analytical challenges that can frequently be met. for example, investigators might choose outcome measures that are appropriate for both adults and children. additionally, using bayesian approaches to link the estimates of treatment effects in children to the values observed in adults may enhance the statistical power to detect pediatric specific effects. finally, centralized institutional review boards and data monitoring centers may alleviate practical concerns with conducting trials among adults and children simultaneously. conclusions the current standard of testing critical care interventions in adults before children rests on tenuous ethical arguments and is entrenched by the methodologic and logistic barriers encountered with alternative approaches. however, these barriers will frequently be surmountable. we therefore propose that the default paradigm be changed such that interventions are examined routinely in critically ill children and adults simultaneously unless unique reasons exist to the contrary.",0.26666666666666666,0.11910669975186104,0.2487450457109476
