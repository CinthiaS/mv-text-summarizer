"As reviewed here the mouse models representing a range of enzyme deficiencies in the FAO pathway have been instrumental in our further understanding of the pathophysiology of these disorders in human patients.

That is, individuals with two different heterozygous enzyme deficiencies in the same metabolic pathway (mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation) will be at risk for acute metabolic disease.

The benign nature of influenza in North American swine changed after the acquisition of gene segments from human and avian influenza viruses in 1998 raising the question of which gene(s) made the virus more active in pigs. These viruses possessed gene segments similar to those in the H1N1/N2 triple reassortant viruses found in North American swine plus the newly introduced NA and M genes of European swine origin. The likely explanation for the origin of this novel H1N1 influenza virus is that a reassortment event occurred between the North American triple reassortant and the European swine influenza virus.,PMC2746644.json,the novel h1n1 influenza virus that emerged in humans in mexico in early and transmitted efficiently in the human population with global spread has been declared a pandemic strain. here we review influenza infections in swine since and the introduction of different avian and human influenza virus genes into swine influenza viruses of north america and eurasia. these introductions often result in viruses of increased fitness for pigs that occasionally transmit to humans. the novel virus affecting humans is derived from a north american swine influenza virus that has acquired two gene segments (neuraminidase (na) and matrix (m)) from the european swine lineages. this reassortant appears to have increased fitness in humans. the potential for increased virulence in humans and of further reassortment between the novel h1n1 influenza virus and oseltamivir resistant seasonal h1n1 or with highly pathogenic h5n1 influenza stresses the need for urgent pandemic planning.,0.4777327935222672,0.1306122448979592,0.3168454514384878

"As the separation between the central bar and the flankers as well as the ISI increased, the more visible the central bar became. In particular, as could be seen in experiment 1, the larger the separation between central bar and flankers became, the longer the ISI needed to be in order to produce low visibility of the central bar.

"Using Pitx3 deficient mice that lack a nigrostriatal pathway, we report here that cocaine induced increases in locomotor activity and sensitization of locomotor activity are dependent on an intact nigrostriatal pathway. In contrast, cocaine CPP, sucrose preference, and enhanced sucrose preference subsequent to repeated cocaine exposures are intact, suggesting these are independent of the nigrostriatal pathway. However, this seems unlikely as the sucrose preference data demonstrate that repeated administration of cocaine sensitizes the reward system in these mice similar to control mice, further supporting the idea that cocaine reinforcement is intact in these mice .",PMC2752723.json,"both the dorsal and ventral striatum have been demonstrated to have a critical role in reinforcement learning and addiction. dissecting the specific function of these striatal compartments and their associated nigrostriatal and mesoaccumbens dopamine pathways, however, has proved difficult. previous studies using lesions to isolate the contribution of nigrostriatal and mesoaccumbens dopamine in mediating the locomotor and reinforcing effects of psychostimulant drugs have yielded inconsistent and inconclusive results. using a naturally occurring mutant mouse line, aphakia, that lacks a nigrostriatal dopamine pathway but retains an intact mesoaccumbens pathway, we show that the locomotor activating effects of cocaine, including locomotor sensitization, are dependent on an intact nigrostriatal dopamine projection. in contrast, cocaine reinforcement, as measured by conditioned place preference and cocaine sensitization of sucrose preference, is intact in these mice. in light of the well established role of the nucleus accumbens in mediating the effects of psychostimulants, these data suggest that the nigrostriatal pathway can act as a critical effector mechanism for the nucleus accumbens highlighting the importance of intrastriatal connectivity and providing insight into the functional architecture of the striatum.",0.4233576642335766,0.19117647058823528,0.33064695358321883
