"The average age of the world population is on the rise. By the year 2050, an estimated 21.1% (>2 billion) of the worlds population will be over the age of 60 . As a result, alternative low cost, non pharmacological methods are necessary and arising as promising treatments for preventing cognitive decline.Two cohorts of participants were simultaneously and independently recruited from the same community. Printed leaflets, brochures, and community recruitment stations were used to recruit participants. Age (year), gender, and education (year) were also included in the model as covariates.The T1 weighted structural images were acquired with a Magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo sequence (MPRAGE). The scanning parameters were as follows: Echo time (TE) = min, flip angle = 15 degree, slice thickness= 1mm, field of view=240 mm, 164 contiguous slices .

"The National Healthcare Quality Reports estimated 11.6 cases of post operative sepsis per 1,000 elective surgery discharges with hospital length of stay longer than 3 days. Sepsis remains one of the leading causes of death in the United States and surgical patients account for approximately one third of all sepsis cases. As payers move toward performance based reimbursement, evaluation of hospital performance will become more important and studies focusing on higher risk surgical procedures and best practices to prevent possible complications may offer future targets for intervention.This database was developed as part of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) and sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). The most current NIS data includes approximately 8 million hospitals admissions annually and, utilizing the weighting function methodology provided by HCUP, allows for the computation of national estimates with variances for specific variables. All data were analyzed and results were reported utilizing the weighting methodology included with the NIS and as previously reported in other epidemiologic outcomes studies in surgery.The majority of the patients (51.4%) were 65 years and above, female (P<0.0002), and white (82.1%). More than half of all patients were insured by Medicare (51.7%) and 37.9% were privately insured . Observations with post operative sepsis had the following ICD 9 CM diagnosis codes in any secondary position (suggesting a complication from the surgical procedure) for the diagnosis codes: Streptococcal septicemia (038.0), Staphylococcal septicemia unspecified (038.10), Staphylococcus aureus septicemia (038.11), Other Staphylococcal septicemia (038.19), Pneumococcal septicemia (038.2), Septicemia due to anaerobes (038.3), Gram negative organism unspecified (038.40), Hemophilus influenzae (038.41), Escherichia coli (038.42), Pseudomonas (038.43), Serratia (038.44), Septicemia due to other Gram negative organisms (038.49), Other specified septicemias (038.8), Unspecified septicemia (038.9), Septic Shock (785.52), Other shock without mention of trauma (785.59), Systemic inflammatory response syndrome due to infectious process without organ dysfunction (995.91), Systemic inflammatory response syndrome due to infectious process with organ dysfunction (995.92).",PMC2951484.json,"objectives to evaluate the incidence of postoperative sepsis after elective procedures, to define surgical procedures with the greatest risk for developing sepsis, and to evaluate patient and hospital confounders background data the development of sepsis after elective surgical procedures imposes a significant clinical and resource utilization burden in the united states. we evaluated the development of sepsis after elective procedures in a nationally representative patient cohort and assessed the impact of sociodemographic and hospital characteristics on the development of postoperative sepsis. methods the nationwide inpatient sample was queried between 2002 2006 and patients developing sepsis after elective procedures were identified utilizing the patient safety indicator postoperative sepsis (psi 13). case mixadjusted rates were calculated by using a multivariate logistic regression model for sepsis risk and an indirect standardization method. results 6,512,921 weighted elective surgical cases met the inclusion criteria and 78,669 cases (1.21%) developed postoperative sepsis. case mix adjustment for age, race, gender, hospital bed size, hospital location, hospital teaching status, and patient income demonstrated esophageal, pancreatic, and gastric procedures represented the greatest risk for the development of postoperative sepsis. thoracic, adrenal, and hepatic operations accounted for the greatest mortality rates if sepsis developed. increasing age, blacks, hispanics, and men were more likely to develop sepsis. decreased median household income, larger hospital bed size, urban hospital location, and non teaching status were associated with greater rates of postoperative sepsis. conclusions the development of postoperative sepsis is multifactorial and procedures most likely to develop sepsis did not demonstrate the greatest mortality after sepsis developed. factors associated with the development of sepsis included race, age, hospital size, hospital location, and patient income. further evaluation of high risk procedures, populations, and environments may assist in reducing this costly complication.",0.3149606299212599,0.04107424960505529,0.20001923353032106
"Quitting smoking engages these resources by requiring an individual to inhibit habitual, automated behaviors (such as lighting a cigarette) and maintain new goal oriented behaviors on a regular basis ; therefore, impairments in these systems have the potential to negatively impact smoking cessation attempts. However, there is some debate over the direction and interpretation of these changes in BOLD signal. This may be related to declining efficiency in cholinergic and dopaminergic systems during healthy aging .On the session days, those with a positive drug screen, a breath alcohol test >0.01, or a breath carbon monoxide (CO) test >9ppm (abstinent session only) were excluded. All subject imaging sessions were acquired on the same scanner (Siemens Tim Trio 3 Tesla, Erlangen, Germany; 32 channel head coil) using the same imaging sequences. BOLD fMRI was acquired using a whole brain, single shot, multi slice, gradient echo (GE) echoplanar (EPI) sequence of 308 volumes with the following parameters: TR/TE=3000/30 ms, FOV=448x448 mm, matrix=64X64, flip angle=90, slices=40, slice thickness/gap=3mm/0mm and effective voxel resolution=3.4  3.4  3.4.Another potential limitation is our exclusion of individuals with comorbid Axis I psychiatric disorders.

"This neglect is somewhat surprising. After all, the human skin, a target for vibrotactile stimulation, is the largest of our sensory receptor surfaces, ~1.7 m2 in average adults . Measurements of visual detection or identification in the presence of noise have been used to quantify visions efficiency (Gold et al., 1999) and to identify the particular features that subjects use to perform a task .Using equivalence bounds of (0.0768, 0.0768), calculated with n = 23 subjects at 80% power and  = 0.05, Two One Sided Tests (TOST) for equivalence were significant in all noise levels at  = 0.05 [0% noise: t(22) = 1.93, p = 0.034; 20% noise: t(22) = 2.52, p = 0.01; 40% noise: t(22) = 2.88, p = 0.004], allowing us to conclude that the observed difference between proportions of the two types of errors was statistically equivalent to zero. 2.1.

"In part, this controversy stems from the fact that elevated levels of TRLs and remnants often coexist . Humans with chylomicronemia have severe hypertriglyceridemia but low levels of cholesterol rich remnants. Very recently, chylomicronemia has been observed in a young man with a homozygous missense mutation in GPIHBP1.Lipoprotein diameters were measured by laser light scattering.

"Clearly, these results call for comprehensive in vivo studies, as in vivo modifications and activities of protein drugs ultimately determine their clinical outcome. We have previously extended this method by trapping the resulting methyl isoaspartate esters, which are intrinsically labile, with hydrazines and various tags, allowing affinity enrichment and orthogonal detection. If separation can be achieved, peak assignment is typically inferred from the elution order.As illustrated in , isoAsp introduces an extra methylene group into the peptide backbone and results in a beta peptide linkage, compared to a typical alpha peptide linkage rendered by Asp. Moreover, relative to peptide backbones, the stereochemistry of the chiral center next to the amide is inverted when Asp is converted into isoAsp, essentially generating a D amino acid from the L Asp as depicted in . It should be noted that cleavage at the N terminal side of glutamic acid (Glu11) in A1 16 was also observed, albeit less than 5 %.A linear gradient from 2 % to 40 % mobile phase B over 30 minutes was used to separate Lys C digest of A1 42 and isoA1 42.

"However, pepsin generates non specific cleavages, which increase the complexity of the digests. To locate the exact linkage positions of disulfides, ESI MS/MS in the negative mode has been suggested. Recently, electron capture dissociation (ECD) and electron transfer dissociation (ETD), have been reported to facilitate the identification of disulfide linkages .It should be stressed that heating at 90 C was utilized to generate sufficient amount of modified peptide for the MS/MS analysis using the AB4700 instrument. Peaks at m/z=674.0 (3+) and 1010.5 (2+) correspond to the fully digested product. It should be noted that since atriopeptide contains only a single pair of cysteines, the homodimer formation should, in theory, not occur before the digestion.To study these modifications, atriopeptin, a small 23 amino acid peptide was first selected as a model compound. None Separate stock solutions of atriopeptin, lysozyme and somatostatin (1 g/L) were prepared in deionized water and stored at  20 C.

"3) acquired, which is a result of ingestion or inoculation of TSE contaminated materials. Both kuru, a TSE once endemic in the Fore tribe of New Guinea and variant CJD, which has been linked to BSE and can be transmitted via blood, are examples of acquired forms of TSE. It is processed through the secretory pathway where it is glycosylated at two N linked glycosylation sites and eventually attached to the cell surface via the GPI anchor.The  helix model, proposed by Fred Cohen and coworkers , is based upon a threading analysis methodology developed earlier . The disulfide linkage and glycosylation would be retained outside of the stackable  helix core and the C terminal residues including  helices 2 and 3 would not be affected . The spiral protofibril model, proposed by DeMarco and Daggett, is fundamentally different from the  helical model.In particular, a key loop region composed of residues ~165171 displays structural variations between species and is thought to influence species specific intermolecular contacts, perhaps acting as a nucleation site in the conversion process. However, there are no corresponding structures of PrP res due to problems with insolubility and heterogeneity of purified samples.

" Many cardiac arrest victims who achieve return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) eventually succumb to a post resuscitation syndrome characterized by hemodynamic instability, maladaptive inflammation, metabolic derangements, and impaired neurological recovery.  A recent multi center analysis of patients admitted to intensive care units after receiving cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for presumed IHCA or OOHCA demonstrated an association between hospital mortality and lowest blood glucose concentration measured during the first 24 hours. Recognizing the need for specific blood glucose control guidelines for post cardiac arrest patients, the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) has recently recommended a more moderate target for blood glucose concentration of up to 144 mg/dL (8 mmol/L).Our study was unable to account for the possible effects of post resuscitation quality of care and other unmeasured clinical variables including those related to the treatment of post ROSC blood glucose abnormalities. Also, given the size of the confidence intervals in our survival model , the possibility of making a Type II error should be recognized. Finally, given the relatively small number of cases, the authors decided in advance that further stratification of glucose values into smaller quantiles would likely result in unacceptably large confidence intervals.Together, these associations suggest that blood glucose management may be more relevant to the non diabetic than the diabetic patient. Also, the avoidance of potentially deleterious effects of hypoglycemia may take precedence over the maintenance of extremely tight glucose control ranges following IHCA.

All cases of keratinizing SCC from the oropharynx (3 cases), oral cavity (3 cases), and larynx (1 case) did not label with p16INK4A . Detection of HPV DNA by PCR/pyrosequencing did not correlate with a diagnosis of SCC (P = .36) .Each assay has its limitations, including the gold standard of E6/E7 expression. Antigen retrieval was performed with a pressure cooker (30 minutes at 115C). The slides were incubated with peroxidase blocking reagent, followed by the primary antibody (dilution 1:50), and finally the visualization reagent (secondary goat antimouse immunoglobulin and horseradish peroxidase linked to a dextran polymer backbone).",PMC2933039.json,"background we investigated p16ink4a expression in branchial cleft cysts and its utility in distinguishing branchial cleft cysts from metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (sccs) in fine needle aspiration biopsies (fnabs). methods a study set comprising resections (15 scc and branchial cleft cysts) and a test set of fnabs (11 scc and branchial cleft cysts) were analyzed with p16ink4a immunohistochemistry and human papillomavirus (hpv) polymerase chain reaction (pcr)/pyrosequencing. cases with discrepant p16ink4a and pcr/pyrosequencing results were further evaluated with hpv in situ hybridization (ish). sccs were divided into keratinizing scc and nonkeratinizing scc groups and site of origin. results metastatic oropharyngeal nonkeratinizing scc in the study set exhibited diffuse, strong p16ink4a (7 of 7) and hpv16 dna positivity (6 of 6), while keratinizing scc from the larynx and oral cavity was negative for p16ink4a. p16ink4a reactivity in the branchial cleft cyst study set was characterized by focal, strong staining (6 of 21) involving the superficial squamous epithelium. hpv dna was identified in of branchial cleft cyst study set cases by pcr/pyrosequencing, but these cases were negative by hpv ish. in the test set, oropharyngeal nonkeratinizing scc exhibited diffuse, strong p16ink4a (3 of 3) and hpv16 dna (2 of 2), while metastatic keratinizing scc was negative for p16ink4a and hpv dna. all fnabs of branchial cleft cysts were negative for p16ink4a. diffuse, strong p16ink4a correlated with oropharyngeal origin (p = .001) and nonkeratinizing morphology (p = .0001). conclusions branchial cleft cysts can exhibit focal strong reactivity limited to the superficial squamous epithelium and glandular epithelium. although p16ink4a immunohistochemistry may be helpful in distinguishing oropharyngeal nonkeratinizing scc from branchial cleft cysts in fnab specimens, it is not helpful in cases of keratinizing scc because these cases are typically negative for p16ink4a.",0.339622641509434,0.06736842105263158,0.20275062040896974

"Cancer is a chronic disease that could be prevented (, ). Recent evidence suggests epigenetic alterations precede genetic mutations during cancer development. Among these, some of the most promising chemopreventive agents include ursolic acid (UA), sulforaphane (SFN), phenethylisothiocyanate (PEITC), and curcumin.In addition to the direct inactivation of ROS/RNS, there are other antioxidant enzymes that facilitate the detoxification of ROS/RNS using reduction/conjugation reactions and the recycling of thiols. The enzymatic soluble products of these reactions are easily excreted. These enzymes play an important role in this protective machinery as detoxifying enzymes that conjugate endogenous polar molecules to the phase I metabolites, thereby facilitating xenobiotics (including carcinogens) elimination and excretion .Molecular docking experiments have shown the metabolite of SFN and several structural related ITCs directly interact with the HDAC catalytic core to inhibit the enzyme activity .

"Measuring changes in genome wide transcript abundance in glomeruli and tubulointerstitial compartments of kidney biopsies can define the effect(s) of CKD associated SNPs on transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. GWAS analyses are powered to identify common variants with small effect in patients with common diseases, and the functional consequences of the identified variants have remained unclear . Also, our focus is on non coding SNPs because, first, these variants have been the most common output from GWAS analysis, and, second, because their mechanism and function are less well defined than alterations in protein coding regions .However, the functional mechanism responsible for co regulation may range from a direct interaction at the molecular level to alteration in the cellular fabric of the tissues studied. Therefore, defining experimental validation for these dependencies can be challenging . In this case, promoter regions of differentially regulated mRNAs can be screened for the presence of putative or experimentally validated transcription factor binding sites, which are altered by a GWAS associated SNP.In addition, more sophisticated models will need to be developed that are open to the integration of additional measures of regulatory activity, such as miRNA levels, post transcriptional regulation, as well as epigenetic modifications.

However, since estimates of the adjusted ORs in those instances changed no more than 20% (and less than 10% for the vast majority of estimates)and in no case did the point estimate change from the observed beneficial direction (i.e., adjusted OR > 1) to a detrimental direction (i.e., adjusted OR < 1)we posit that the essential relationships, and thus our conclusions, remain unchanged and that the lack of significance observed is due to the decrease in power stemming from the smaller sample sizes in models that exclude participants with non overlapping propensity scores or no matches falling within the caliper width .",PMC2891366.json,"health and psychosocial service needs that may be co morbid with opioid addiction may impede the success of drug treatment among patients attending methadone maintenance treatment programs (mmtps). this longitudinal panel study investigates whether receipt of services from one or more helping professionals outside of the mmtp confers a benefit for drug treatment outcomes among a random sample of male mmtp patients (n = 356). each participant was interviewed times, with months between each interview. since this observational study did not employ random assignment, propensity score matching was employed to strengthen causal validity of effect estimates. results support hypotheses that receiving additional off site services has significant beneficial effects in increasing the likelihood of abstaining from cocaine, heroin, and any illicit drug use over both the ensuing month and month time periods. these findings indicate that receipt of additional medical and/or psychosocial services enhances the efficacy of methadone treatment in increasing abstinence from illicit drug use.",0.3004115226337449,0.0371900826446281,0.1716543048619748
"The impact of cannabinoids with use beginning in adulthood remains an open area of research, as little has been reported in this area. It is likely CB1 receptors in other regions of the hippocampal formation modulate other forms of memory and consolidation processes .

"Additionally, pOHMAMP and pOHAMP may undergo glucuronidation or sulfation prior to terminal excretion. Immunoassay testing is quick and economical, but susceptible to cross reactivity with compounds structurally similar to the target compound. For this reason, the identities of compounds triggering positive immunoassay results must be confirmed by a more specific technique, most often gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) or liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS).Specimen preparation included methanol homogenization and solid phase extraction.

"According to role incompatibility theory, individuals adjust behaviors across the lifespan as they adopt new roles that may be incompatible with these behaviors . For example, alcohol use decreases after marriage (; ; ). However, factors associated with adolescent motherhood (such as economic hardship and psychological problems) are also associated with problem drinking, so it is important to consider such factors in multivariable analysis .Data from three prenatal cohorts from Magee Womens Hospital were merged for integrative data analysis, ensuring adequate power for the proposed analyses . Anxiety and hostility were measured with the State Trait Anxiety Index (STAI: ). A score for chronic hostility was generated by adding a point for each assessment that mothers scored 18 on the hostility subscale of the STAI .The multivariate models considered covariates from several domains, including sociodemographic (race, economic hardship), maternal psychological status (anxiety, depression and hostility) and other prenatal substance use. Financial strain was assessed by asking mothers how often they were short of money at the end of the month, how often they could not buy essential things for their child(ren), and how often they could not do extra things for their child(ren) (alpha = .73).

"It is estimated that sickle cell anemia affects more than 70,000 Americans . Because predominant hemoglobin S (HbS) red cells block blood vessels due to their reduced pliability and increased adhesiveness, patients with SCD have a hospitalization rate 7 to 30 times higher than persons aged less than 60 years and are more likely to undergo surgical procedures to treat persistent or acute organ dysfunction []. Moreover, surgery related processes, such as hypoxemia and cytokine release, increase red blood cell sickling and adhesion, anemia, and the frequency of vaso occlusion.However, given the procedures of interest, we assumed that this possibility had minimal impact. Although it was our intention to exclude these individuals from the analyses, a previous analysis of children in the NIS reported that at least one third of cases identified with vaso occlusive and pain crises were coded as having sickle cell traitpresumably in error, as sickle cell trait is not associated with these complications .

"The current studys overarching aim is to integrate two common approaches to understanding income based gaps in student educational outcomes.

Academic and behavioral problems also co occur within children and when they do, jointly predict child performance across domains. Parents with low household income often report decreased physical and mental health compared to their higher income peers, as well as higher relationship and family conflict, both of which are damaging to child development and learning (e.g., ; ; ; ).This association is easier to understand in light of the item content of this scale, whereby teachers reported whether children were withdrawn, or crie[d] too much.

"Experimental work has shown that even a partial loss of foot cutaneous information not only results in increased postural sway during standing but also leads to slowing of gait speed and maladaptive postural changes during termination of gait. Further, studies involving patients with peripheral neuropathy suggest that a deficit in ankle proprioception is a primary contributor to their balance problems, and it explains more than 50% of the variance in performance on the timed standing test. Similarly, the role of foot vibrotactile sensitivity in stepping recovery response for regaining stability after perturbation during standing has been demonstrated.During standing, the center of gravity is maintained within a constant base of support defined by the feet. In addition, the center of mass needs to be controlled within this changing base of support against its acceleration, initially in the forward direction and then immediately in the vertical direction.

"Ephrins and their corresponding Eph receptors are divided into A and B classes based on their structure, ligand affinity, and membrane linkage. Ephrins exert their biological functions by binding to Eph receptors, which comprise the largest family of receptor tyrosine kinases. In addition to Eph/Ephrin signaling, ephrins can act in an Eph receptor independent manner through reverse signaling .Death without documented recurrence was censored at the date of death.

"However, these different theoretical models do not tend to distinguish between the representation of priors and likelihoods. Although these theories are not necessarily mutually exclusive, they offer different predictions, and none so far has received strong neurobiological support. For instance, in a classic visual discrimination task, monkeys view a cloud of randomly moving dots and need to identify their net direction[, ].We did not find any imaging evidence of an interaction between priors and likelihoods (for additional tests and controls, see and ). The position of the coin was drawn from a Gaussian distribution, centered on the center of the screen with a standard deviation (std) that was either low (p=2.5% of screen width) or high (P=8.5% of screen width). The x position of each of these dots was drawn independently from a second Gaussian distribution in which the mean was the coins horizontal location on that trial and the standard deviation was either low (l=6%) or high (L=15%).We were particularly interested in knowing: Plots represent the subject averaged parameter estimates converted to PSC for the four conditions (n=15).

"However, sufficient data have been published over the past 3 decades suggesting that prescribing can be suboptimal (ie, overuse, underuse, or misuse). Of concern is that these different types of suboptimal prescribing can lead to adverse health outcomes, especially medication related adverse patient events (ie, adverse drug events [ADEs], adverse drug withdrawal events, and therapeutic failures). Unfortunately, previous reviews either are outdated or focus on a single drug class (eg, psychotropic drugs) or intervention (eg, pharmacists).The in facility training was done by a psychologist, a nurse, and occupational therapists over 10 months. This improvement did not result in changes in the use of other psychotropics or behavioral complications. Case notes were audited by nurses blinded to allocation for demographic information, diagnoses, and stroke risk factors.The first class, CNS medications, was studied in 4 of the trials. Thus, CNS medications should be used cautiously and with diligent monitoring because of the potential to both worsen cognitive impairment and lead to falls.

Genetic risk information has alternatively been hypothesized to increase motivation to change behavior by increasing perceived risk or to decrease motivation by weakening efficacy beliefs or heightening fatalism.About half were 50 years of age or older (46%). Sixty percent reported a household income of less than $50,000; 39% had no education beyond high school. About 59% were overweight or obese (body mass index of 25.0 kg/m2 or higher) .Longitudinal research is needed to explore further this association. Trained interviewers administered the telephone survey to a representative sample of households drawn from U.S. telephone exchanges; exchanges with high proportions of Black and Hispanic residents were oversampled.

"Mehta and Zydney developed an appropriate framework for comparing the performance characteristics of different ultrafiltration membranes based on a plot of the membrane selectivity (or separation factor) as a function of the membrane hydraulic permeability (Lp). The appropriate selectivity for conventional ultrafiltration processes is equal to the flux of solvent divided by the flux of the macromolecule to be retained, which is simply equal to the reciprocal of the macromolecule sieving coefficient (Sa). Chandler and Zydney showed that the initial rate of flux decline during yeast cell microfiltration was reduced for membranes with slit shaped pores compared to membranes with circular pores, with the difference in fouling behavior arising because the deposited cells are unable to fully block the slit shaped pores due to their high aspect ratio.Alternatively, the non zero sieving coefficient for the largest Ficolls could reflect the presence of a very small number of defects in the silicon membrane and/or to a small leakage flow around the membrane, although there was no independent evidence for either of these explanations .

"Raising excise taxes on tobacco products is the most effective tobacco control strategy among the policies advocated by the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC).  There are in total six different types of tax structures: specific uniform (quantity based, a single rate), specific tiered (quantity based, multiple rates), ad valorem uniform (value based, a single rate), ad valorem tiered (value based, multiple rates), mixed uniform (both quantity based and value based, single rates) and mixed tiered (both quantity based and value based, multiple rates). For example, when the bases are values or a mix of both values and quantities, each different product bears a different amount of taxes.GEE is a panel data technique that accounts for intertemporal correlations. The analyses were conducted using the XTGEE . Due to the sample size limitation, logistic regressions were used for the LMIC analyses to achieve a convergence .Countries that allow local governments to differentiate taxes (ie, USA, Canada and India) account for 22% of the sample.

"With its popularity rivaled only by carbon nanotubes (CNTs), the buckyball (C60) is the most commonly investigated closed shape carbon nanomaterial, and varying forms are under development for an array of applications [, ]. At the time of the writing of this manuscript, when using < fullerene > as a search term, more than 2,000 manuscripts could be retrieved from the Toxicity Literature Online (TOXLINE) database and more than a dozen from the Developmental Toxicology Literature (DART) database. Nonetheless, prudence is advised when interpreting toxicity data on nC60 prepared in a carrier solvent, because transformation of the solvent can lead to unexpected toxic effects independent of the fullerene itself .Even though the preparation of aqueous C60 dispersions is often conducted in the presence of an organic solvent, stable colloids can also form during extensive stirring in water alone. The chemistry and forces behind nC60 particle formation have been scrutinized in detail []. Nevertheless, substantial accumulation of these aggregates is expected near the source of contamination.Moreover, chromatography on alumina resulted in quantitative (91 %) conversion of C60O into C60 . For instance, in fractions of low polarity, C60OmHn species with low m+n are to be expected, and these may be stable enough to be defunctionalized by heat treatment alone or heating in the presence of alumina. This would enrich less functionalized and non functionalized C60 in the early fractions and enrich highly hydroxylated fullerols in the later ones.",PMC3725142.json,"owing to their exceptional properties and versatility, fullerenes are in widespread use for numerous applications. increased production and use of fullerenes will inevitably result in accelerated environmental release. however, study of the occurrence, fate, and transport of fullerenes in the environment is complicated because a variety of surface modifications can occur as a result of either intentional functionalization or natural processes. to gain a better understanding of the effect and risk of fullerenes on environmental health, it is necessary to acquire reliable data on the parent compounds and their congeners. whereas currently established quantification methods generally focus on analysis of unmodified fullerenes, we discuss in this review the occurrence and analysis of oxidized fullerene congeners (i.e., their corresponding epoxides and polyhydroxylated derivatives) in the environment and in biological specimens. we present possible strategies for detection and quantification of parent nanomaterials and their various derivatives.",0.291005291005291,0.0425531914893617,0.21654079278042235

"Chromatin remodeling by acetylation of histone molecules plays an essential role in the activation of gene expression. By decreasing the acetylation of lysine residues in histone tails, histone deacetylases (HDACs) condense chromatin structure and repress gene transcription. HDAC inhibitors induce the expression of a subset of genes involved in cell growth arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis, which accounts for the antitumor effects of these compounds .Although pathogen recognition begins at the level of the receptor, it is the signaling components downstream of each receptor and the ways in which they interact that ultimately determine the specific transcriptional response and immunological outcome . They have also raised interesting questions. First, are there additional anti inflammatory targets of HDAC inhibitors?The findings of Cao et al. have advanced our knowledge in this area by identifying acetylation of MKP 1 as an important mechanism by which TLR signaling is inhibited. This finding should open the way to gaining deeper mechanistic insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms that control innate immunity.

"Accelerated CD4 decline and disease progression is associated with the emergence of viruses able to use CXCR4 in greater than 50% of subtype B infected individuals . These studies point mostly to V3 characteristics such as increased positive charge, changes at amino acid 11 and 25 and increased loop length associated with CXCR4 usage, similar as in subtype B. Despite all these similarities subtype specific conformational differences within the stem and loop of V3 suggest other mechanisms and possibly the result of infrequent development of CXCR4 in subtype C. The V3 region is an important determinant of coreceptor use, but other regions such as V1/V2 and V4 V5 have also been implicated . Previous work from this laboratory has identified potential barriers to the acquisition of CXCR4 use in subtype B infection including extensive mutation in the V3 region of envelope, compensatory mutations elsewhere in envelope to maintain viral fitness, and loss of entry efficiency via CCR5 as CXCR4 use is gained ,  .The neighbor joining tree was drawn using Kimura 2 parameter and bootstraps values >85% indicated (*) on branches with only non recombinant clones represented.

"Dyssynchronous contraction can be caused by abnormal electrical activation of the LV (e.g., left bundle branch block [LBBB]), structural changes to the myocardium (e.g., areas of scar caused by ischemia), or both, ultimately preventing normal LV activation and contraction.

"Flat panel detectors (FPD) based on thin film transistor arrays are now considered as an alternative to conventional x ray image intensifiers (XII) because they provide geometric distortion and veiling glare free images . XIIs have fulfilled these requirements over many decades of use. The results of their studies were dependent on the subjective performance of observers using a contrast detail method to evaluate the relationship between contrast resolution and dose.The key differences between the three detectors are in their CCD camera coupling arrangements (direct fiber optic coupling in the MA and the HSMAF versus mirror lens coupling in the MAF) and whether there is an additional gain stage (no additional gain in the MA versus an added variable gain dual stage micro channel plate (MCP) light image intensifier (LII) in the MAF and the HSMAF). To eliminate grid lines, the antiscatter grid was removed from the XII input. The constant k1 is proportional to the constant k2 and their differences are unimportant for this analysis.A simple formal treatment of the instrumentation noise in terms of the detector entrance exposure was developed and applied to three custom designed CCD fiber optic based systems of different sensitivities and to a commercial x ray image intensifier system, and was compared with values for a flat panel detector system reported by other investigators.

"Stroke has the startling tendency to disrupt these processes leading to debilitating clinical syndromes such as aphasia, ataxia, and aprosodia. Nevertheless, these previous reports describe patients with damage restricted to only a part of the AF, whereas the present report discusses total absence of AF . Specifically, they suggest that the connection between Brocas area and the posterior temporal region, also described as Wernickes area, is subserved by two distinct tracts: the superior longitudinal fasciculus III (SLF III), which connects Brocas area to the inferior parietal lobule, and the caudal part of the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), which connects the inferior parietal lobule to the caudal superior temporal region.Images were acquired using an 8 channel SENSE head coil on a Philips 3 T MRI scanner.

In particular, the previous studies showed that what was considered to be the AF is actually comprised by two fiber tracts: the superior longitudinal fasciculus III, connecting the inferior frontal area (Brocas area and in particular Brodmanns area 44) to the inferior parietal lobule and the ILF, connecting the inferior parietal lobule to the posterior superior temporal area (Wernickes area).

"They found that participants compensated even when the manipulation was described to participants prior to the experiment, and participants were explicitly instructed not to compensate. This attenuation is believed to be driven by the efference copy. The MMN is generally observed when a memory trace is formed for a stimulus, or a stream of stimuli, and a stimulus is encountered which violates that memory trace (see , for review).This finding is consistent with the results of who found that compensation responses carried over within and between trials when speaking a nonsense word. A particularly important question to investigate is how much adaptation occurs between trials. That is, the cumulative effect of repeated exposure has not been quantified.After utterance onset, a goal change occurs to a stabilization mechanism, which uses the current F0 as the pitch goal (variable referent). This suggests that F0 is not universally controlled by an efference mechanism, but that different mechanisms for F0 control and stabilization can be used to suit different goals within different contexts.

"Aptamers are usually isolated from combinatorial oligonucleotide libraries by the SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment) process, but natural aptamers also exist. Because of the similarity between this signal on strategy and our signal off one, both strategies have some shared advantages over most other existing ones. On the other hand, compared to the label free strategies where the reporting molecules lack the selectivity against specific aptamers, these two strategies are suitable for the multiplexing detection because different reporting molecules can be conjugated to the molecular beacons specific to the different aptamers .If not specified, all the other reagents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St Louise, MO).

If a high sensitivity is required, the sensitivity could be improved by using high affinity aptamer, and/or changing the sequence and the dye quencher pair of the competitor, and/or optimizing the probe concentration and the buffer composition.

"However, degassing introduces considerable experimental delays and the approach is limited to solutions that are not damaged by evacuation or freeze thaw cycles. This subsequent injection avoids depolarization by oxygen and degassing induced mechanical damage but, at least to some degree, alters the chemical composition of the sample . However, bubbling yields low dissolved xenon concentrations due to the low xenon partial pressures typically used in SEOP (1% xenon) and can lead to susceptibility artifacts unless liquid flow is stopped during data acquisition .Provided that there is a constant supply of gas, the mass transport across the membrane is therefore expected to be essentially independent of gas flow . Similar behavior was also observed for initial gas volumes of 100 to 300 ml and gas flows ranging from 2 to 15 ml/min. Relaxation in the reservoir should depend on the surface to volume ratio within the Tedlar bag and thus be influenced by the initial inflation volume, xenon gas flow, and the duration of the experiment.For studying samples such as unbound biomolecules or blood, the setup can easily be modified to accommodate much smaller volumes by recirculating the liquid using only a peristaltic pump.

Echocardiographic measurements of LVM are also important for risk stratification in overweight and obese patients, including those without other overt CV risk factors .The current study was composed predominantly of Caucasian subjects (91%) which may limit the generalizability of findings to other racial groups . Relative wall thickness (RWT) was calculated as 2  PW/Dd. ,We then compared measurements of LV geometry and mass by both FI and HI in a prospective consecutive group of 51 subjects (29 women, age 48  16 years, NW: n=26, OW: n=25). There were no differences in LV diameters, wall thickness, or LVM by FI vs. HI and the agreement between measurements of LV geometry and mass between HI and FI were excellent. There were no other clinically meaningful systematic over or under estimation of measurements of LV wall thickness or LVM between HI and FI .",PMC2993783.json,"background multiple studies have reported echocardiographically determined normal reference values for left ventricular mass (lvm) derived using fundamental imaging (fi). modern ultrasound systems now use harmonic imaging (hi) due to the improved lv endomyocardial definition. however, the american society of echocardiography (ase) recommendations noted that the applicability of the reference values to hi derived measurements has not been established. methods lv end diastolic volume, diameter, wall thickness, and mass were determined using hi in healthy subjects (n=251) including a normal weight (nw, body mass index [bmi] < kg/m2, n=149, 68% women) and an otherwise healthy overweight (ow, bmi and <30 kg/m2, n=102, 41% women) groups. measurements were compared to ase endorsed reference values. the agreement between fi and hi was determined in a prospective cohort of subjects. results 2d derived lv volumes were similar between nw and ow subjects; although m mode (mm) derived lv diameters were slightly greater in ow. 2d and mm derived lvm was greater in ow compared to nw subjects, including after adjustment by height or height2.7; however, indexing to body surface area eliminated these differences. the partition values for abnormal 2d and mm derived lvm were generally greater in nw and ow subjects of both sexes compared with the ase endorsed values (except mm derived in nw men). however, there were no significant differences in lvm determined by hi compared to fi in a prospectively studied cohort. conclusions reference values for lvm derived from nw and ow cohorts are generally higher than the ase endorsed referenced values. the difference between nw and ase endorsed values is unlikely to result from the use of hi rather than fi since there is excellent agreement between these two imaging modalities. this study emphasizes the need to update normal reference values to reflect modern imaging methods.",0.4444444444444445,0.09784735812133072,0.2565617849982978

involvement of the ventral pallidum (vp) in cocaine seeking behavior, in contrast with considerable documentation of the involvement of its major afferent, the nucleus accumbens, over the past thirty years utilizing electrophysiology, lesion, inactivation, molecular, imaging, and other approaches. the vp is neuroanatomically positioned to integrate signals projected from the nucleus accumbens, basolateral amygdala, and ventral tegmental area. in turn, vp projects to thalamoprefrontal, subthalamic, and mesencephalic dopamine regions having widespread influence across mesolimbic, mesocortical, and nigrostriatal systems. prior lesion studies have implicated vp in cocaine seeking behavior, but the electrophysiological mechanisms underlying this behavior in the vp have not been investigated. in the present investigation, following two weeks of training over which animals increased drug intake, vp phasic activity comprised rapid phasic increases or decreases in firing rate during the seconds prior to and/or following cocaine reinforced responses, similar to those found in accumbens. as a population, the direction (increasing or decreasing) and magnitude of firing rate changes were normally distributed suggesting that ventral striatopallidal processing is heterogeneous. since changes in firing rate around the self administering lever press occurred in animals that escalated drug intake prior to neuronal recordings, a marker of addiction like behavior in the rat, the present experiment provides novel support for a role of vp in drug seeking behavior. this is especially important given that pallidothalamic and pallidomesencephalic vp projections are positioned to alter dopaminoceptive targets such as the medial prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, and dorsal striatum, all of which have roles in cocaine self administration.",0.2484756097560976,0.07022900763358779,0.16506781277719404

"Parental feeding practices, defined as specific behaviors parents use to influence what, when, and how much a child eats, can have varying effects on a childs mealtime behavior and whether a child is a picky eater . For instance, in order to persuade a child who is highly food responsive to eat their vegetables at dinnertime, a mother may offer the reward of dessert after the meal . This approach, however, may not be effective in a child with low food responsiveness.A research assistant presented both the mother and child with individualized portions of four different foods that were offered one at a time, sequentially, and in randomized order, to the dyad concurrently. Each food was presented individually and removed after the allotted time period.

"The chief advantage of such an approach is that equivalent image resolutions can be achieved with much lower magnification. Because 125I is widely used in molecular biology, owing to the wide array of molecules that can be easily iodinated and to the fact that its half life (59.4 days) is convenient for radiolabeling, such a system tailored for the imaging of 125I labeled tracers is potentially of practical use as well. Several recent reports of systems tailored for small animal imaging of 125I using novel detector systems indicate both demand for such imaging capability and interest in 125I imaging as a testbed for new imaging concepts , ,  .Using software provided by the manufacturer, a gain calibration was performed for all 640 p strips using an 241Am source.

"Although iron is abundant in the Earths crust, its natural forms are poorly soluble, and so its supply is often insufficient for optimal growth and function of either microbes or their hosts. Within hours of infection in humans and other vertebrates, concentrations of iron in extracellular fluid and plasma dramatically decrease (hypoferremia). Macrophages involved in recycling iron from erythrocytes limit the release of the recycled iron, thus lowering the extracellular iron concentration.The role of the Nramp1 gene in innate immunity was originally identified because a mutation in Nramp1 occurring in common mouse strains conferred susceptibility to infection with intracellular microbes that localize in macrophages, including Mycobacteria, Salmonella typhimurium and Leishmania donovanii. Although controversy about the specific mechanism still persists, it now appears that Nramp1 acts by depleting Fe2+, Co2+ and Mn2+ from the phagosome, and thereby starving the phagosomal microbes of these essential nutrients. Nramp1 expression in macrophages is transcriptionally induced by interferon  and lipolysaccharide through a mechanism involving the Interferon Regulatory Factor 8 , thus linking macrophage activation to a specific iron dependent microbistatic mechanism .After an inflammatory stimulus such as IL 6 or lipopolysaccharide, the development of hypoferremia in human volunteers coincided with the rise in hepcidin[;]. Genetic deficiency of hepcidin is the fundamental cause of hereditary hemochromatosis, with additional cases due to ferroportin mutations causing resistance to hepcidin.

BCL6 encodes a 95 kd nuclear zinc finger phosphoprotein which functions as a sequence specific transcriptional repressor.Briefly, hematoxylin and eosin stained sections from each tissue block were used to define diagnostic areas, and 3 representative 0.6 mm cores were obtained from each case. Nuclei were counterstained with 4,6 diamidino 2 phenylindole (DAPI) in Antifade solution and the slides were visualized using an Olympus BX51 fluorescence microscope. Images were captured and archived using Cyto Vision software (Applied Imaging, Santa Clara, CA, USA).One (case #15, ) had a BCL6 MBR rearrangement. The numbers of positive cases in each group are too small for statistical analysis . Of the remaining 12 cases, one contained a chromosomal translocation involving 3q29 and three had trisomy 3.",PMC2736319.json,"a frequent chromosomal translocation in mature b cell non hodgkin lymphoma affects band 3q27 and results in deregulation of the b cell lymphoma (bcl6) gene. two breakpoint clusters have been described thus far, the major breakpoint region (mbr) and an alternative breakpoint region (abr) that is located kb 5' to bcl6. translocation at the mbr predominates in diffuse large b cell lymphoma, whereas translocation at the abr is reported to be frequently associated with grade 3b follicular lymphoma. however, translocation at the abr has not been studied in a large series of follicular lymphomas, particularly t(14;18) negative follicular lymphomas. therefore, we studied blc6 rearrangements at the mbr and abr by using break apart fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) probes in cases of follicular lymphomas, including t(14;18) negative and t(14;18) positive cases. conventional cytogenetic (karyotype) analysis was also performed in of the t(14;18) negative cases. bcl6 rearrangement was found in 26% of t(14;18) negative and 19% of t(14;18) positive follicular lymphoma. t(14;18) negative cases showed a high frequency of rearrangement at the abr (12%) with an abr:mbr ratio of 0.86, compared to only 5% with an abr:mbr ratio of 0.36 in the t(14;18) positive cases. bcl6 rearrangements were found in all grades of follicular lymphoma but were most frequent in grade t(14;18) negative follicular lymphoma (60%). fish analysis had a higher sensitivity for detecting bcl6 rearrangements than conventional cytogenetics. in conclusion, bcl6 rearrangements occur at a similar frequency in t(14;18) negative follicular lymphoma and diffuse large b cell lymphoma. however, t(14;18) negative follicular lymphoma appears to have a higher frequency of rearrangement at the abr compared with t(14;18) positive follicular lymphoma and diffuse large b cell lymphoma. therefore, it is important to perform fish analysis with abr to determine possible involvement of bcl6 rearrangement in follicular lymphoma, especially in t(14;18) negative cases.",0.28571428571428575,0.038240917782026776,0.18744394219455895

"However, several critical factors likely influenced the WHIMS negative results, including the advanced age of the subjects, delayed timing of HT initiation in relation to when menopause occurred, and the presence of pathological states (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, obesity) [; ; ; ]. Animal models have proven useful in investigating different parameters of HT neuroprotection in ways that otherwise are not possible in women. Unlike rodents , female macaques have 28 day menstrual cycles and patterns of ovarian hormone fluctuations that are similar to those of human females [; ].In comparison to images obtained pretreatment, there was a significant increase in D2 receptor binding in the basal ganglia following three months of ET . The primate DA mesocortical system is not as consistent in responding to HT. Collectively, these findings in the primate DA mesocortical system suggest that the effects of OVX and ET in this DA system may depend on the timing or duration of the manipulations, or that the mesocortical system may be less sensitive to these manipulations in comparison to the mesostriatal DA system .While evidence is accumulating, it is clear that many questions remain unanswered regarding the factors that play a role in the cognitive neuroprotection afforded by HT. Longer durations of ET (23 years) also increased spine densities in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of older OVX monkeys compared to OVX monkeys receiving placebo ; indeed, the spine density in older ET monkeys was nearly equivalent to young OVX monkeys treated with placebo . Finally, ET provided for one month within six months of OVX, increased both pre and post synaptic proteins in the CA1 hippocampal region of OVX monkeys, although the combination of E+P did not have this same effect  .",PMC2847862.json,"many postmenopausal women question whether to start or continue hormone therapy because of recent clinical trial negative results. however, evidence from other studies of postmenopausal women, and from studies in menopausal monkeys, indicate that estrogen has neurocognitive protective effects, particularly when therapy is initiated close to the time of menopause before neural systems become increasingly compromised with age. in this review, we present studies of menopausal women and female monkeys that support the concept that estrogen therapies protect both cognitive function and neurobiological processes.",0.22160664819944598,0.027855153203342618,0.14961654386790388

"Asthma is an obstructive lung condition that involves inflammation of the airways combined with episodes of exacerbation in response to certain triggers. These airway exacerbations, or asthma attacks, consist of increased swelling of the airways, constriction of the muscles surrounding the airways, and increased mucus production that result in a number of aversive and anxiety provoking physical sensations, including wheezing, dyspnea, tightness in the chest, and coughing . This number is expected to grow substantially in the coming years as rates of asthma in the U.S. have increased by 15% in the last decade .We then verified eligibility (i.e., non smoking status) using CO analysis. The AQLQ has exhibited good reliability and validity . Participants actual FEV1 score was compared to a predicted score based on reference values taking gender, age, height, and race into account to calculate a percent predicted score.However, as the values of the correlations were not inconsequential (range: .11 to .25), these non significant findings could also be due to the small sample size being somewhat underpowered to detect small effect sizes .

compared and contrasted the frequency and distribution of exonic mutations in irf6 between two large geographically distinct collections of families with vws and between one collection of families with pps. methods we performed direct sequence analysis of irf6 exons on samples from three collections, two with vws and one with pps. results we identified mutations in irf6 exons in 68% of families in both vws collections and in 97% of families with pps. in sum, novel disease causing variants were found. the distribution of mutations in the irf6 exons in each collection was not random; exons 3, 4, 7, and accounted for 80%. in the vws collections, the mutations were evenly divided between protein truncation and missense, whereas most mutations identified in the pps collection were missense. further, the missense mutations associated with pps were localized significantly to exon 4, at residues that are predicted to bind directly to dna. conclusion the non random distribution of mutations in the irf6 exons suggests a two tier approach for efficient mutation screens for irf6. the type and distribution of mutations are consistent with the hypothesis that vws is caused by haploinsufficiency of irf6. on the other hand, the distribution of pps associated mutations suggests a different, though not mutually exclusive, effect on irf6

"In response to HIV infection, HLA class I molecules play important roles in both T cell mediated adaptive immunity and natural killer (NK) cell mediated innate immunity. Individual HLA class I may influence AIDS pathogenesis by binding and presenting immuno dominant HIV epitopes to T cells and/or interacting with killer immunoglobulin like receptors (KIR) to regulate NK cell activity[, ]. In particular, the HLA B*35Px alleles (a group of B*35 and B*53 subtypes encoding molecules that share similar peptide binding characteristics, mainly comprised of B*3502, B*3503, and B*5301 in our cohorts) associate with rapid progression to AIDS.Blood samples were collected for HIV 1 testing. Women were invited for follow up visits at 6 month intervals for HIV 1 testing and to complete additional questionnaires. Twenty men had two partners (2 of the forty partners became infected) .Diversity in the MHC has been identified as the most significant AIDS regulating genetic factor . In general, the identification of appropriate HIV and HIV+ groups for comparison requires careful consideration, as the available groups have great potential for selection biases that may erroneously result in significant differences between the two groups. This complex is recognized by the natural killer cell receptor KIR3DL1, which may explain the general protection of the group of alleles containing the Bw4 epitope.",PMC2902625.json,"objective hla class i polymorphism is known to affect the rate of progression to aids after infection with hiv 1. here we test the consistency of hla b allelic effects on progression to aids, heterosexual hiv transmission and setpoint viral levels. methods we used adjusted cox proportional hazard models in previously published relative hazard (rh) values for the effect of hla b alleles on progression to aids (n=1089). the transmission study included hiv 1 infected men with hemophilia and their female sex partners (mhcs cohort). among hiv 1 seroconverters (macs cohort), hiv rna levels at setpoint were determined in stored plasma samples by a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay. hla b genotyping was performed by sequence specific oligonucleotide hybridization and dna sequencing. results several hla b alleles showed consistent associations for aids risk, infectivity and setpoint hiv rna. hla b*35 was associated with more rapid progression to aids (rh 1.39; p = 0.008), greater infectivity (or 3.14; p = 0.002), and higher hiv rna (p = 0.01), whereas the presence of either b*27 or b*57 associated with slower progression to aids (b*27: rh 0.49, p < 0.001; b*57: rh 0.40, p <0.0001), less infectivity (or 0.22 and 0.31, respectively, though not significant) and lower viral levels (p <0.0001). importantly, hla b polymorphism in female partners was not associated with susceptibility to hiv 1 infection. conclusion hla b polymorphisms that affect the risk of aids may also alter hiv 1 infectivity, probably through the common mechanism of viral control, but they do not appear to protect against infection in our cohort.",0.33535353535353535,0.05273833671399594,0.20074568528288728
"Likewise, in Eastern cultures, particularly of the south Asian subcontinent, reports of individuals engaging in practices to cultivate awareness of dream and sleep states date back millennia (; ; ). These include meditative practices specifically designed to apprehend the dream state (, p. 156) . The most common version of the eye signaling technique asks participants to signal when they realize they are dreaming by rapidly looking all the way to the left then all the way to the right two times consecutively then back to center in the dream without pausing (referred to as left right left right eye signals, abbreviated as LRLR).Furthermore, the participant did not make eye movement signals to time stamp the moment of lucidity, and it is therefore difficult to ascertain whether the moment of lucidity occurred in the process of awakening. However, due to the study protocol, the experimenters could only collect dream reports the following morning. The other two cases were scored as occurring during N2 episodes since they had spindles and K complexes in the 30 second scoring epoch with the eye signals.However, a limitation is that EEG signals were only evaluated at four electrodes (F3, F4, P3, P4). Consequently, localized changes in EEG spectra may have been missed by the low spatial resolution. However, refinement of the instructions given to participants, as described above, could help further increase the reliability of the technique.",PMC6451677.json,"lucid dreaming refers to the phenomenon of becoming aware of the fact that one is dreaming during ongoing sleep. despite having been physiologically validated for decades, the neurobiology of lucid dreaming is still incompletely characterized. here we review the neuroscientific literature on lucid dreaming, including electroencephalographic, neuroimaging, brain lesion, pharmacological and brain stimulation studies. electroencephalographic studies of lucid dreaming are mostly underpowered and show mixed results. neuroimaging data is scant but preliminary results suggest that prefrontal and parietal regions are involved in lucid dreaming. a focus of research is also to develop methods to induce lucid dreams. combining training in mental set with cholinergic stimulation has shown promising results, while it remains unclear whether electrical brain stimulation could be used to induce lucid dreams. finally, we discuss strategies to measure lucid dreaming, including best practice procedures for the sleep laboratory. lucid dreaming has clinical and scientific applications, and shows emerging potential as a methodology in the cognitive neuroscience of consciousness. further research with larger sample sizes and refined methodology is needed.",0.26,0.04020100502512563,0.19457069580839018
"This is particularly the case for neurological and psychiatric studies that aim for better understanding of disease mechanism. This improvement will be beneficial for the study of psychiatric disorders and comparison of pre/post drug treatment, thereby substantially extending the potential clinical utility of fMRI . The extent of brain activation by flashing checkerboards is known to be dependent on flashing frequency, with 8Hz stimulus inducing the greatest activation which decays at higher or lower frequencies (; ; ; ).The functional paradigm consisted of 10 seconds stimulation followed by 50 seconds of fixation on a cross sign in the center of the screen, and was repeated four times. An additional fixation period of 50 seconds was used at the beginning of the experiment. The slices were positioned axially covering the occipital lobes .Standard response curve is available in most fMRI data processing softwares and is often based on a gamma variate impulse response function .

"Glycosylation, one of the most important co and post translational modifications of proteins, plays a significant role in numerous biological processes including protein folding and stability, cellular adhesion, signaling and disease.  The three major types of glycosylation in living systems are the N , O and C linked sugar structures, which in each case can be highly diverse. The PCT approach can also be coupled with HPLC and mass spectrometry .HPLC grade water was from Baker (Phillipsburg, NJ) and acetonitrile from Fisher Scientific (Fair Lawn, NJ) . IgGs are large glycoproteins with a single conserved N glycosylation site at Asn297 on both heavy chains in the CH2 domain of the Fc region. The G0 (see ) to IS2 (maltose) peak height ratios were 0.08 in both instances.We consider that the high pressure facilitated conformation changes of the target glycoprotein, which in conjunction with the alternation between high and atmospheric pressure probably resulted in rapid unfolding and folding, increasing the accessibility of the endoglycosidase to the cleavage sites. The target glycoproteins required reduction of the disulfide bridges and heat denaturation prior to PCT treatment.

"(, ) Soon, these programs will have a national mandate as the recently passed national health care reform bill includes provisions for Medicare and Medicaid to provide beneficiaries incentives to complete behavior modification programs. By the middle of this century, the population of persons over 65 in the United States will double from 39 million today to 89 million.Informing individuals of the reward they lost by failing to achieve a program goal is thought to produce regret. The disutility of regret provides extra motivation to adhere to a target behavior. The reward for changing an unhealthy behavior, for instance, can be the opportunity for a big payout (e.g., drawing for a one in five chance of a $200 reward).Studies will need to examine particular groups of older adults, rather than simply studying them as a uniform group. Key characteristics to define these groups include those with normal cognition versus those with mild degrees of well characterized cognitive impairment.

This has been attributed to an increasing worldwide adoption of energy dense diets and sedentary lifestyles, probably as a consequence of urbanization and economic globalization.Using WHO criteria for MS, the RR of death from CHD was 2.9 (95% CI, 1.26.8) to 3.3 (95% CI, 1.47.7). Similarly, in a meta analysis of worldwide data from studies published between 1998 and 2005, random effects estimates of the combined RRs of the MS as defined by NCEP ATP III criteria were 1.27 (95% CI, 0.901.78) for allcause mortality, 1.65 (95% CI, 1.381.99) for CVD, and 2.99 (95% CI, 1.964.57) for diabetes; for the smaller number of studies that used the most exact WHO definition, the fixed effects estimates were 1.37 (95% CI, 1.091.74) for all cause mortality and 1.93 (95% CI, 1.392.67) for CVD . Similarly, results from the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study and Air Force/Texas Coronary Atherosclerosis Prevention Study showed that placebo treated patients with NCEP ATP IIIdefined MS had age adjusted HRs of 1.5 (95% CI, 1.21.8) and 1.4 (95% CI, 1.041.9), respectively, for major coronary events during a median follow up of 5.4 years.Patients with MS or T2DM are at an increased risk for CVD.

"In glaucoma, retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thinning results from progressive loss of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons. For example, optical coherence tomography (OCT) uses light and interferometry to determine the depth of surfaces differing in reflectance much in the way sonar or ultrasound uses sound. In part, this is due to the direct contribution of these BVs to RNFL thickness as measured by OCT and, in part, due to the correlation between the location of these BVs and the location of the arcuate bundles.The eyes had intraocular pressure (IOP) 21 mmHg, a healthy appearing optic disc, no history of ocular disease, and reliable (less than 33% fixation losses, false positive and negative responses) normal visual fields (SITA, program 242; Humphrey Field Analyzer II, Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, California).

"Phoneme awareness assessment has become a critical part of early identification and diagnosis of reading disability.

"Already in 1845, Griesinger postulated that senility can be attributed to arteriosclerosis but vascular dementia (VaD) was clearly delineated by Otto Binswanger and Alois Alzheimer who first recognized its specificity by separating it from neurosyphilis . However, subsequent studies demonstrated that MRIHs were often present in normal brain aging raising doubts about their clinical significance in elderly cohorts . One main limitation of the MRI studies that may explain these contradictory findings is related to the impure nature of radiological lesions.Clinically, this syndrome is characterized by predominant frontal symptoms such as a dysexecutive syndrome and aberrant behaviors. Neuropathologically, WMLs correspond to a heterogeneous group of histological changes such as demyelination and pallor, lacunar infarcts, dilated periventricular spaces, astrogliosis and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (; ; ; ; ; ; ).

From a neurobiological viewpoint, two recent findings aim to provide a molecular background to this hypothesis.

"Serum creatinine concentration has replaced GFR measurement in most clinical settings because of its ease and widespread availability; however, because serum creatinine likely does not increase above reference range until approximately 75% of nephrons are nonfunctional, and falsely increased creatinine concentrations may occur with some assays, the sensitivity and specificity of creatinine for diagnosis of kidney disease should be considered inferior to actual determination of GFR . Finally, accurate measurement of GFR may, in theory, be used for drug dose adjustments in patients with renal disease in order to avoid overdosing of medications that are renally excreted, or alternatively to allow earlier detection of nephrotoxicity . Currently available methods may be difficult, expensive, or require multiple blood draws or 24 h urine collection.It is produced at a constant rate from breakdown of creatine phosphate in muscle tissues and is only minimally influenced by protein intake, metabolism or physical activity .

"NIRS requires only compact experimental systems, is less restrictive, and is relatively forgiving of body movement, and thus provides one with a wide variety of flexible measurement options of brain function in adults and infants (reviewed in ; ) .

"In veterinary medicine, the majority of new diplomates now pursue non academic career pathways. While many issues may play a role in this trend, such as the income gap between private practice and academia and levels of student debt, other factors may attract potential faculty to or repel them from academic careers. Several researchers have studied generational differences in populations of medical, dental, pharmacy, and nursing students.Tufts Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine comprises three different departments: Clinical Sciences, Biomedical Sciences, and Environmental and Population Health. After the initial distribution, two reminders were sent electronically to encourage response. Commercial statistical softwareb was used for all analyses; statistical significance was set at p < 0.05 .The proportions of male and female respondents were not significantly different between the faculty (23 female, 15 male) and house officer groups (27 female, 18 male; p > 0.05). Most faculty (74%) indicated that they probably or definitely plan to stay in academia until they retire .

"By studying samples in a highly hydrated solid state gel that preserves the conformational dynamics, but avoids lineshape sharpening by molecular tumbling, information on anisotropic motions is retained. Thus, the combined measurement of quadrupole echo lineshape, Zeeman spin lattice relaxation (T1Z) and quadrupolar order relaxation (T1Q) allows the quantitative characterization of atomic motions occurring at rates between 104 and 1010 s1 ,  . Using this approach we find that the extrahelical residues, U23 and U25, experience significant conformational exchange over the ns s timescale.This dependence should be transmitted by fluctuations of the sugar phosphate backbone, involving numerous torsion angles. Line shape and T1Z simulations were then performed using the programs MXET1, EXPRESS, and Turbopowder. Here pS indicates a phosphorothioate label, 2FU or 2FC indicates a 2 fluorine substitution, and *U indicates a [5,6 2H] base labeled Uridine).In contrast, our approach yields both amplitudes and rates of motion . The spectroscopic data for U38 are well described by a combination of 13 twisting and 13 bending, corresponding to a movement of the entire upper helix which carries the U38:A27 base pair, occurring at a rate of 1.4106 s1. However, due to the absence of an apical loop, the more compact lower helix likely undergoes motions of amplitude similar to or even larger than those we observe for the upper helix.",PMC2864776.json,"many rnas undergo large conformational changes in response to the binding of proteins and small molecules. however, when rna functional dynamics occur in the ns s time scale they become invisible to traditional solution nmr relaxation methods. residual dipolar couplings methods have revealed the presence of extensive ns s domain motions in hiv 1 tar rna, but this technique lacks information on the rates of motions. we have used solid state deuterium nmr to quantitatively describe trajectories of key residues in tar by exploiting the sensitivity of this technique to motions that occur in the ns s regime. deuterium lineshape and relaxation data were used to model motions of residues within the tar binding interface. the resulting motional models indicate that two functionally essential bases within the single stranded bulge sample both the free and tat bound conformations on the microsecond timescale in the complete absence of the protein. thus, our results strongly support a conformational capture mechanism for recognition: the protein does not induce a new rna structure, but instead captures an already populated conformation.",0.3828715365239295,0.05063291139240506,0.21300495633464153

"Not only does it produce the hardest tissue among vertebrates, but it is also a process in which the extracellular matrix disintegrates in parallel with giving rise to a 96  98 wt% mineralized tissue with an extraordinary superstructural organization. Mature enamel is composed of 40  60 nm wide and up to several hundred microns long hydroxyapatite (HAP) fibers packed in a parallel fashion within rod shaped structures of 4  6 m width . It is exactly this minimal involvement of the cell that opens the door for biomimicry studies that exclude the presence of relevant cell and tissue cultures .Morphological changes over a 7 day period in a representative experiment are shown in . Despite the variations in the ionic concentrations, the degree of saturation did not exhibit significant fluctuations. This observation is in agreement with previous studies that have shown that Amg due to its predominantly hydrophobic nature does not provide a convenient nucleation promoting surface.Bioimitational growth of enamel will likewise depend on the abilities to control the coordination of these three elements of the process. The experimental setup based on a feedback controlled delivery of precipitating ions to the self assembling protein matrix could present a convenient starting point for both understanding the mechanism of amelogenesis at the nano scale and gaining control over the organic/inorganic interactions of interest.

"This reflex pathway was originally studied in animal models, which indicated afferent vestibular hair cells in the saccule to be responsive to click and tonal auditory stimulation at high intensity levels in cats and guinea pigs (; ; ; ). Auditory sensitive neurons have also been located in the lateral and descending vestibular nuclei of guinea pigs . Of importance, is a lack of a uniform means of SCM muscle contraction strength monitoring between these studies (; ; ).The blood pressure cuff was pre inflated around the subjects flat hand which was then held against the face at the zygomatic arch area. The subject monitored the blood pressure meter in order to obtain constant feedback regarding the amount of pressure being applied into the cuff with a head turn.

"Activated PI3K catalyzes phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2) to generate phosphoinositide 3 (PIP3) . The homologue of PHLPP in yeast termed CYR1 retains PHLPP domain structure. However, how endogenous PHLPP is activated remains unknown .In vitro studies showed that only 10% Akt activity came from single phosphorylation event at Thr308 and maximal Akt activation required phosphorylation at both Ser473 and Thr308 sites . Endogenous AC is localized predominantly in the plasma membrane, but is also found in multiple intracellular subdomains in cardiac myocytes .

"Alkanes are an important class of compounds with a variety of commercial and industrial uses, such as in petroleum refining, as industrial solvents, and in a wide range of products including oils and cosmetics[, ]. Aliphatic groups are also widely present in organic and biological systems; therefore, accurate representations of alkanes and aliphatic groups are desirable towards the goal of efficient molecular modeling of such systems. Accurately capturing the dielectric environment in alkyl environments has implications in modeling processes involving strongly charged systems within phospholipid bilayer systems (see for instance, Allen et al , Roux et al , and Bucher et al ) .For all systems, we have calculated the RDFs for water oxygen to alkane carbons using both the original model and our revised model. It is clear from these profiles that the changes made to the model have virtually no effect on the solvation structure of the alkanes in water. This is important, since in parameterizing a model it is possible to reproduce some properties very accurately while others very poorly.Specifically, our previous work has shown that inclusion of polarization enhances the amount of water penetration into phospholipid bilayers compared to traditional fixed charge force fields. More rigorous treatment of the hydration free energy, and therefore the solvation process in general, is an important step towards a better representation of the interaction of water with the bilayer interior.

In 2006, investigators from Germany and the UK, using transfected cell lines (HEK 293 and RBL cells), described their inability to demonstrate the binding of either C3a or C3a des Arg C5L2 to these cells.What is confusing is the extent to which C3a and C3a des Arg bind to C5L2. Interestingly, it has been recently shown that the vast majority of C5L2 exists intracellularly in endosomal compartments and is translocated to the cell surface after cell activation (Gerard, C., personal communication).

"Recognizing this problem, Western nations have issued laws (, ) and guidelines (, ) intended to promote pediatric trials of new drugs . Furthermore, in the European Union, children may be excluded from RCTs anytime investigators argue that it is appropriate to conduct studies in adults before initiating studies in the pediatric population, or when studies in the pediatric population will take longer to conduct than studies in adults The National Institutes of Health allows investigators to opt out from including children for similar reasons . Similarly, although we use the term children to refer to developing humans beyond the neonatal period who lack legally sanctioned autonomy, we acknowledge that some of the arguments may apply to neonates as well .For example, RCTs of drugs may require weight based dosing for all patients.

The question then becomes: how can disparities be mitigated and where can and should we intervene?

"As numerous reviews have noted, the symptom of pain accounts for over 80% of all physician visits; chronic pain affects over 50 million Americans annually, and the annual costs of chronic pain likely exceed $100 billion in health care expenses and lost productivity. In the context of these conditions and others, it is now widely accepted that only a modest relationship exists between identifiable physical pathology and a patients report of pain symptoms. Although relatively few researchers have investigated the putative neurobiologic underpinnings of catastrophizing directly, recent work strongly suggests that catastrophizing related cognitions have effects on the central nervous system.For example, in several studies of healthy young adults, catastrophizing predicted increased systolic blood pressure reactivity to pain and enhanced myocardial contractility for a prolonged period of time following a cold pressor task. As reviewed by Edwards et al, the neurochemical processes that produce temporal summation of pain are at least somewhat distinct from those mediating the NFR. For example, N methyl D aspartic acid antagonists reduce temporal summation pain, but they do not affect NFR thresholds.Similarly, a study of intravenous pentazocine in healthy adults revealed that increased indices of catastrophizing were associated with less subsequent analgesic benefit of pentazocine, especially among men. Such counterirritation analgesic effects had been shown to be opioid mediated in prior studies that used competitive antagonists, such as naloxone. Participants were scanned while receiving moderately painful electrical stimulation under various conditions, with perceptions of helplessness and threat measured after each stimulus.",PMC2738609.json,"the well accepted biopsychosocial model proposes that the experience of pain and responses to it result from a complex interaction of biological, psychological, and social factors. however, the separation of these constructs is substantially artificial, and we presume that psychological processes have biological effects, that biological processes affect an individuals psychosocial environment, and so on. considerable research has demonstrated that pain coping strategies influence perceived pain intensity and physical functioning, and individual differences in styles of pain coping even shape the persistence of long term pain complaints in some populations. a good deal of this coping research has focused on catastrophizing, which is a generally maladaptive cognitive and emotional mental set that involves feelings of helplessness when in pain, rumination about pain symptoms, and magnification of pain related complaints. collectively, catastrophizing has been consistently associated with heightened experiences of pain across a variety of samples. although catastrophic thinking regarding pain related symptoms is often classified under the psychologic category within the broader biopsychosocial model, we propose that catastrophizing exerts biologic effects that may account for some of its negative consequences. in general, the cognitive and affective processes captured within the construct of catastrophizing may exert effects on the neuromuscular, cardiovascular, immune, and neuroendocrine systems, and on the activity in the pain neuromatrix within the brain. the interface between pain related neurobiology and processes such as pain related catastrophizing represents an important avenue for future pain research.",0.34710743801652894,0.06224066390041493,0.20909348790536245

series of transgenic mice designed for expression of human alr2 (akr1b1) in epithelial and outer cortical fiber cells of the lens. one of the founder lines, designated par39, developed an early onset cataract that involved formation of a plaque of cells at the anterior aspect of the lens. these cells appear to separate from the anterior epithelium and undergo a dramatic change that is reminiscent of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (emt). we characterized this phenotype in the par39 strain by examining rates of cell proliferation and by immunostaining for markers of emt. incorporation of the thymidine analog bromodeoxyuridine (brdu) was used to estimate cell proliferation in two functional areas of the lens epithelium: the mitotically active germinative zone (gz) and the less proliferative center zone (cz). staining cell nuclei with diamido 4',6 diamidino 2 phenylindole (dapi) was used to establish a total cell count in the demarcated areas. lens epithelium in par39

observed in the cz (0.6% compared to 3.3%). however, cell density was greater within the gz of par39 mice as compared with nontransgenic controls, while it was not significantly different in the cz among the two groups. furthermore, cells associated with the epithelial plaque did not stain positive for brdu, but were strongly positive for alpha smooth muscle actin, a classical marker for emt. these findings suggest that alr2 over expression is associated with an alteration in the balance between proliferation and apoptosis of epithelial cells in the mouse lens, and that cells associated

"It is crucially important to review the entire issue of memory security from a new angle, utilizing new technologies . However, while a parity bit can only indicate that an error has occurred, multiple sequence alignment enables the location and type of the possible error to be determined . The remainder of the article begins by describing the biological process by which sequences are synthesized in Section II.In order to encompass the gene sequence, plasmid vectors are spliced open with restriction enzymes so the new sequence can be inserted. A restriction enzyme is a small protein sequence that aligns with a specific complementary DNA sequence and cleaves the sequence at such location  . Once again the restriction enzyme is aligned with the vector to cleave the DNA.In order to verify randomness, one must verify that sequences have uniformity and are non correlated.

"The accuracy in estimating absorber concentrations is superior when time resolved or frequency domain measurements are used because these data types provide a measure of the average photon path length, which allows diffusion theory to be used to separate absorption from scattering values []. Corlu et al. proposed an approach to select the optimal wavelength set that best quantifies tissue properties by maximizing the uniqueness of the inverse problem and equalizing the contribution of different chromophores . This system was used to perform heterodyne measurement at the wavelength range from 700 to 845 nm, which covers the major spectral feature of oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO2) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (Hb).The gelatin phantom was composed of porcine gelatin (Sigma Aldrich G2500), TiO2 powder (Sigma Aldrich T8141), porcine blood, and saline. A chemical microsensor (Diamond general development corporation, Ann Arbor, Michigan) showed that the StO2 was around 50% during measurement. Several studies have been presented to find the optimum wavelength set for better quantification in chromophores .The ability to select more wavelengths significantly improved spectral reconstruction and generated more accurate information about chromophore and scattering properties. The results here demonstrate the proof in principle that the system can work, and, while expensive, it has major benefits for biomedical and scientific applications. The system can also be utilized in a parallel implementation where the spectrum is subdivided and all wavelengths are detected in parallel, as was demonstrated previously .",PMC2804890.json,"frequency domain near infrared (nir) diffuse spectral tomography with a mode locked ti:sapphire laser is presented, providing tunable multiwavelength quantitative spectroscopy with maximal power for thick tissue imaging. the system was developed to show that intrinsically high stability can be achieved with many wavelengths in the nir range, using a mode locked signal of mhz with heterodyned lock in detection. the effect of cumulative noise from multiple wavelengths of data on the reconstruction process was studied, and it was shown that inclusion of more wavelengths can reduce skew in the noise distribution. this normalization of the data variance then minimizes errors in estimation of chromophore concentrations. simulations and tissue phantom experiments were used to quantify this improvement in image accuracy for recovery of tissue hemoglobin and oxygen saturation.",0.38227146814404434,0.05013927576601671,0.20649594897902915

"The increasing world population has generated the need to raise yields of primary production, resulting in turn in an increased use of conventional pesticides to control pest damages in crops. The use of classical pesticides yields effective results in the short term, but it has different drawbacks, such as the development of resistance and the adverse environmental effects on the biotic and abiotic environment.

"Do you have a lengthy commute to work? Although the biophysics of kinesins is increasingly well understood, many cell biological questions remain mysterious. In imac embryos, motoneuron axons extend properly and are guided to and arrest on the appropriate muscle fibers, but synapses cannot form.These accumulations are alleviated by the overexpression of either the ubiquitin hydrolase, fat facets (faf) or the MAPKKK, wallenda (wnd). The kinase activity of wnd promotes the activation of Hep, increased phospho JNK, and decreased binding of APLIP1 with KLC. Figure 3When a developing axon meets an appropriate target, a functioning synapse can form within minutes. Mutations of a ubiquitin ligase (highwire), or overexpression of a ubiquitin hydrolase (fat facets) or MAPKKK (wallenda, DLK in mammals) causes dramatic overgrowth of synapses at the neuromuscular junction and homologs in C.elegans also regulate presynaptic development .

"The entire genome is packaged within the confines of the nucleus, such that genes are able to dynamically interact with the nuclear neighborhood that surrounds them and regulatory proteins can access genes via a diffusion based mechanism. Evidence has accumulated supporting the notion that gene positioning may have a functional impact on gene regulation [for reviews, see ,,]. In the process, we will discuss the direct or indirect effects that specialized nuclear compartments could have on the transcription of genes in close proximity.(C) Nuclear neighborhood associated proteins (red), may indirectly affect transcription in combination with other protein factors (blue) by stabilizing inter /intra chromosomal interactions, or by shielding associated genes from the effect of nearby heterochromatin . This study shows that SATB1, which functions as both a chromatin organizer and transcription factor, is able to bind to multiple DNA regions throughout the MHC class I gene cluster . Rather, soluble isoforms of PML protein diffusing away from PML NBs may be able to mediate DNA looping at the MHC class I locus.In this instance, a freely diffusible protein constituent may bind and activate/repress genes and subsequently become associated with a particular nuclear compartment through either dynamic localization of the bound gene to an existing nuclear compartment, or through the nucleation and de novo formation of a nuclear compartment at the bound gene. In addition, proteins associated with a nuclear neighborhood may indirectly affect transcription by stabilizing inter /intra chromosomal interactions, or shielding associated genes from the effect of nearby heterochromatin (e.g. SATB1/PML and CTCF/NPC associations) .

"It is a metabolic byproduct of L arginine metabolism that inhibits the formation of nitric oxide (NO), one of the bodys important anti oxidants. This interference with the formation of NO has significant ramifications, because NO has numerous beneficial effects, including stimulating arterial relaxation and dilation, reducing platelet aggregation and macrophage adherence, maintaining blood vessel elasticity and slowing or reversing atherosclerotic plaque growth.

"Chemisorption also imparts a certain degree of stability to SAMs, and this has promoted their use in a wide assortment of applications in surface science and nanotechnology. This feature has special relevance for surfaces in physiological settings, where biogenic thiols such as cysteine and glutathione can act as competing adsorbates and contribute toward surface degradation and biofouling . Several of these structures have been featured in recent studies involving antifouling surfaces or the selective penetration of cell membranes.The normalized SHG intensity ISHG is proportional to the square of the sum of nonlinear susceptibilities at the substrate, adsorbate, and interface (sub, ads, and int respectively); the latter term is highly sensitive to changes in surface states due to chemisorptive bonding. An alternative approach for measuring saturation coverage is based on the adlayer approximation model introduced by Fadley, which uses the differential intensities from the substrate and adsorbed species and takes full account of sampling geometry and detection efficiency (see for details). Measurements of adlayer coverage at normal and 60 photoemission angles are remarkably similar, with mean values of 0.46 and 0.45 ML derived from N 1s and S 2p peak intensities, respectively.For more complex amines, some care should be taken to reduce competitive counterion adsorption to ensure efficient DAM assembly.

"1) the intrarenal 1 adrenoreceptor (through renal sympathetic nerves and circulating catecholamine stimulation), 2) the intrarenal baroreceptor, and 3) the macula densa mechanism .The study of the in depth molecular mechanisms regulating this process would be more easily addressed using an in vitro cell culture model. For instance, several binding sites are shared by more than one factor, sometimes with opposite effects: the RAR/RXR binding site stimulates transcription in the presence of its ligand vitamin A and inhibits transcription when bound to vitamin D [, ]. Interestingly, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR) seems to activate renin transcription through sites in both the enhancer and proximal promoter [, ].We expect that in the near future, experiments using these and new models will definitely accelerate the pace of discovery in this field . Relevant questions that remain to be answered include 1) the identification of the signals that control the developmental pattern of renin expression,",PMC2861778.json,"renin is the key regulated step in the enzymatic cascade that leads to angiotensin generation and the control of blood pressure and fluid/electrolyte homeostasis. in the adult unstressed animal, renin is synthesized and released by renal juxtaglomerular cells. however, when homeostasis is threatened, the number of cells that express and release renin increases and extends beyond the juxtaglomerular area; the result is an increase in circulating renin and the reestablishment of homeostasis. the increase in the number of renin cells, a process termed recruitment, is achieved by dedifferentiation and re expression of renin in cells derived from the renin lineage. the mechanisms that regulate the related processes of reacquisition of the renin phenotype, renin synthesis, and renin release are beginning to be understood. numerous studies point to camp as a central common factor for the regulation of renin phenotype. in addition, we are seeing the emergence of gap junctions and micrornas as new and promising avenues for a more complete understanding of the complex regulation of the renin cell.",0.3551401869158878,0.03761755485893418,0.2472545361762879
"Human skeletal muscle functional studies are notable for the variety of methodological approaches used. For the purposes of assigning cause effect relationships between muscle function and individual performance, it is desirable to obtain direct muscle function measurements in a clinically acceptable manner. The importance of this approach is to reflect the clinical use of the device, since one of the intended applications of IMP measurement in humans is to understand movement and aid in the surgical decision making process,.The protocol was approved by the Department of Veterans Affairs, San Diego Committee on the Use of Animal Subjects in Research. Briefly, rabbits were anesthetized with 5% isoflurane and a subcutaneous injection of a ketamine xylazine cocktail (50 and 5 mg/kg body mass, respectively) and maintained on 2% isoflurane anesthesia. Heart rate and oxygen saturation were monitored (VetOx, Heska Co., Fort Collins, CO) throughout the test duration, and anesthesia level was adjusted as needed.Stress at optimal length was 298.23.7 kPa. As seen previously, pressure declined more rapidly than tension at long lengths. An overall significant absolute agreement was found between intramuscular pressure and tension.",PMC2713015.json,"to determine the degree to which intramuscular pressure (imp) and muscle force are correlated in an intact compartment, a custom pressure transducer was inserted into the rabbit tibialis anterior (ta) while activating the muscle via the peroneal nerve and measuring ta muscle force distal to the ankle retinaculum. in general, imp was more variable compared to muscle force throughout the entire isometric length tension relationship. in contrast to results obtained on isolated ta muscles, imp force relations with the compartment intact were not significantly different between the ascending and descending limbs of the length tension curve. specifically, average relative pressure force coefficients of determination (r2) were 0.760.11 for the active ascending limb and 0.980.01 for the active descending limb. these data demonstrate that muscle force and imp are fairly well correlated under isometric conditions and that this relationship is not improved by measuring imp in an intact environment.",0.34808259587020646,0.02967359050445104,0.1894323321976714
"Symptoms include irregular uterine bleeding, pressure symptoms such as increased urinary frequency and constipation; and they may interfere with reproduction. Other antiprogestins have been synthesized and tested in an attempt to identify relatively pure progesterone antagonists with little or no antiglucocorticoid activity, such as CDB2914 and CDB4124 (Proellex)(, ). The manufacturer Repros Therapeutics announced on August 3, 2009 that it is voluntarily suspending all clinical trials of CDB4124 because of significant increases in liver enzymes associated with the drug use  .Thus, we hypothesized that CDB4124 could induce LSM cell apoptosis through down regulation of Bcl 2 expression. To test this possibility, the effects of CDB4124 on Bcl 2 mRNA expression in primary LSM and MSM cells were assessed by real time PCR at 24 or 48 h; and the effects on Bcl 2 protein expression were measured by western blot analysis at 72 h. Experiments in are representative of findings using matched LSM and MSM cells from 3 different subjects .Primers against the constitutively expressed glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were used as described in previous reports . The cycle threshold (Ct) was placed at a set level where the exponential increase in PCR amplification was approximately parallel between all samples. Relative fold change was calculated by comparing Ct values between the target gene and GAPDH as the reference guide.",PMC2872031.json,"objective to evaluate the effects of selective progesterone receptor modulator cdb4124 on cell proliferation and apoptosis in cultured human uterine leiomyoma smooth muscle (lsm) cells and control myometrial smooth muscle (msm) cells in matched uteri. design laboratory research. setting academic medical center. patient(s) premenopausal women (n=12) undergoing hysterectomy for leiomyoma related symptoms. intervention(s) treatment of primary lsm and msm cells with cdb4124 (10 8 10 6m) or vehicle for 24, or hours. main outcome measure(s) western blot for protein expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (pcna), cleaved poly adenosine 5 diphosphate ribose polymerase (parp), bcl 2 and krppel like transcription factor (klf11); mtt assay to evaluate viable cell numbers; and real time polymerase chain reaction to quantify mrna levels. result(s) treatment with cdb4124 significantly decreased levels of the proliferation marker pcna, the number of viable lsm cells, and the anti apoptotic protein bcl 2. on the other hand, treatment with cdb4124 increased levels of the apoptosis marker cleaved parp and the tumor suppressor klf11 in a dose and time dependent manner in lsm cells. in matched msm cells, however, cdb4124 did not affect cell proliferation or apoptosis. conclusion(s) cdb4124 selectively inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in lsm but not in msm cells.",0.3427230046948357,0.07547169811320754,0.18435941063061775
"Less is known about the structural arrangement of laminae. The electrical transients are fast, acting on time scales in the microsecond range, which translates into steep depolarization wavefronts of small spatial extent in the sub millimeter range, thus requiring the use of fine spatial resolutions << 250 m to compute solutions with reasonable accuracy. On the other hand, mechanical processes tend to occur at larger space and slower time scales, and, thus, coarser spatial discretizations can be used.To appropriately account for the bimodal distribution of orientations, higher spatial resolutions would be required than those commonly used within FE studies, including this study. That is, the orthotropy in the propagation of the action potential in the LV model was governed by the mean orientation of the fibers and the sheets. However, the chosen activation sequence, which approximates a normal beat where the entire endocardium is activated almost simultaneously, leads to a strongly transmural activation where effects of electrical orthotropy are strongly attenuated.The enforced incompressibility condition is responsible for this reduced contraction, as can be seen from the analytical expressions  and . From a physiological point of view, there is also an interpretation. This shift is similar to what is commonly seen when inflating a thick walled tube .",PMC3970090.json,"summary we present an approach to model the dispersion of fiber and sheet orientations in the myocardium. by utilizing structure parameters, an existing orthotropic and invariant based constitutive model developed to describe the passive behavior of the myocardium is augmented. two dispersion parameters are fitted to experimentally observed angular dispersion data of the myocardial tissue. computations are performed on a unit myocardium tissue cube and on a slice of the left ventricle indicating that the dispersion parameter has an effect on the myocardial deformation and stress development. the use of fiber dispersions relating to a pathological myocardium had a rather big effect. the final example represents an ellipsoidal model of the left ventricle indicating the influence of fiber and sheet dispersions upon contraction over a cardiac cycle. although only a minor shift in the pressurevolume (pv) loops between the cases with no dispersions and with fiber and sheet dispersions for a healthy myocardium was observed, a remarkably different behavior is obtained with a fiber dispersion relating to a diseased myocardium. in future simulations, this dispersion model for myocardial tissue may advantageously be used together with models of, for example, growth and remodeling of various cardiac diseases.",0.3184079601990049,0.05,0.21626202541241307
"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common and growing problem worldwide; in the United States, >10% of adults showing some evidence of kidney damage and/or reduced kidney function . Despite these known adverse consequences of CKD, the majority of persons with the disease, especially prior to ESRD, remain unaware of their disease (). However, as shown in , it should be noted that the two types of awareness are far from independent.Regardless of study type, increased severity of CKD appears universally associated with greater awareness of disease status (, , , , ), providing some face validity to the measures of awareness used; presence of proteinuria was also associated with greater awareness , perhaps due to increased symptoms in these individuals. However, presence of CKD symptoms has not been explored as a predictor of CKD awareness, nor has total number or severity of comorbid conditions. Health literacy is just beginning to be explored in CKD but does appear to be positively associated with understanding of personal CKD risk ; health numeracy , which describes an individuals ability to understand numbers as they relate to health (e.g., interpretation of test results, calculation of dosages, and understanding of dietary portions and nutrients), is likely to be quite important in CKD awareness and self management but remains unexplored.Additionally, no single dataset or study population will be sufficient to study all predictors and outcomes of CKD awareness, and outcome studies require substantial resources. Early referral of patients to nephrologists is optimal, but given the relatively small number of practicing nephrologists nationwide, nephrologists cannot exclusively manage all patients with CKD. The burden of CKD management thus falls largely on PCPs.",PMC2864779.json,"earlier recognition of chronic kidney disease (ckd) could slow progression, prevent complications, and reduce cardiovascular related outcomes. however, current estimates of ckd awareness indicate that both patient and provider level awareness remain unacceptably low. many of the factors that are possibly associated with ckd awareness, which could help guide implementation of awareness efforts, have yet to be fully examined. also, little is known regarding whether increased patient or provider awareness improves clinical outcomes or whether there are possible negative consequences of awareness for ckd patients. further research is necessary to continue to design and refine awareness campaigns aimed at both patients and providers, but there is an immediate need for dissemination of basic ckd information, given both the high prevalence of ckd and its risk factors and the low estimated awareness of ckd.",0.3291770573566084,0.07518796992481203,0.2521018783816942
