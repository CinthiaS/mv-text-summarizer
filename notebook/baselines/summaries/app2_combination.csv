"They found that after 40 weeks of intervention, significant increases in brain volume were observed in the Tai Chi Chuan and social intervention groups compared to the no intervention group. In addition to Tai Chi Chuan, Baduanjin is another popular mind body exercise . We also investigate how Tai Chi Chuan and Baduanjin can regulate the WMS CR subscores, as well as the association between the GMV changes and WMS CR score changes .We decided to choose two cohorts of participant to avoid the potential cross practice of Tai Chi Chuan and Baduanjin, so that participants were aware of only one exercise option. They were also provided free Tai Chi Chuan or Baduanjin training after participation in the study . We first compared the pre treatment regional grey matter volume (GMV) differences between the Tai Chi Chuan, Baduanjin and control groups using a one way ANOVA.The results showed that compared with the control group, both Tai Chi Chuan and Baduanjingroups showed significantly increased GMV at the medial temporal lobe (MTL), putamen, and insula. Significant GMV increases in the putamen were observed in both Tai Chi Chuan and Baduanjin groups as compared with the control group.

"The development of sepsis creates a substantial health care burden and limited epidemiologic information exists with regard to postoperative sepsis. Martin et al. demonstrated that the incidence of sepsis and the number of sepsis related deaths are increasing, although the overall mortality rate among patients with sepsis is declining. Secondary aims included description of sociodemographic factors and hospital characteristics associated with the development of postoperative sepsis.The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) was queried for the years 2002 2006. Being the largest all payer hospital database in the United States it contains information about all hospitalizations from more than 1,000 acute care hospitals representing a 20% weighted probability sample of all US hospitals. Sampling strata created by AHRQ are based on hospital characteristics including geographic region, ownership, location, teaching status, and number of beds and sampling weights are provided to account for the survey design and to provide national estimates.An estimate of 6,512,921 elective surgical cases met the eligibility criteria. The indicator, post operative sepsis (PSI 13), was utilized to identify sepsis as a complication.

"Withdrawal from nicotine precipitates neurocognitive deficits such as impaired working memory . Indeed, subjective cognitive deficits during abstinence as well as objective deficits in working memory, attention and executive function predict relapse among smokers trying to quit . We hypothesized that abstinence would be associated with decreased BOLD signal in the medial frontal/cingulate gyrus (MF/CG) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC).nicotine withdrawal is associated with subtle working memory deficits that predict subsequent relapse. significant age x session effects were found for bold signal change in all three regions, as well as for withdrawal and craving; for all measures, abstinence effects were attenuated in smokers aged >50 years compared to those < 50 years old. these results suggest that abstinence effects on neurocognitive function may be more pronounced for younger smokers, and may indicate a new avenue for research exploring mechanisms underlying age differences in smoking cessation success.The effects of abstinence on BOLD signal in these regions, as well as withdrawal and craving, were reduced in adults aged 50 years and older compared to younger smokers .

"Would systematic degradation help us understand more about the robustness of vibrotactile signals? To address these questions, we had subjects discriminate between sequences of pulses delivered at two different mean rates, 3 Hz and 6 Hz. We wanted to benchmark the robustness of information carried by vibrotactile signals against the robustness of visual information, in particular.To determine whether subjects used optimal criteria as defined by , we tested the proposition that the error rate for 3 Hz stimuli [Pr(fast | slow stimulus)] and the error rate for 6 Hz stimuli [Pr(slow | fast stimulus)] would be sufficiently similar within each noise level as to be reasonably considered equivalent . These results suggest that subjects showed no statistically significant response bias in any of the noise levels, and that they used a decision criterion indistinguishable from one that was statistically optimal . All subjects had best corrected Snellen acuity 20/40 or better.Stimuli with two different mean pulse rates, 3 Hz and 6 Hz, were randomly intermixed; pilot testing showed that these two rates would be reliably, though imperfectly, discriminated. Subjects categorized the rate of each stimulus as either slow (3 Hz) or fast (6 Hz). This shift toward the mean IPI of a 3 Hz stimulus would promote confusion and lead subjects to mistake the nominally 6 Hz stimulus for one of 3 Hz.",PMC6990458.json,"beats are among the basic units of perceptual experience. produced by regular, intermittent stimulation, beats are most commonly associated with audition, but the experience of a beat can result from stimulation in other modalities as well. we studied the robustness of visual, vibrotactile, and bimodal signals as sources of beat perception. subjects attempted to discriminate between pulse trains delivered at hz or at hz. to investigate signal robustness, we intentionally degraded signals on two thirds of the trials using temporal domain noise. on these trials, inter pulse intervals (ipis) were stochastic, perturbed independently from the nominal ipi by random samples from zero mean gaussian distributions with different variances. these perturbations produced directional changes in the ipis, which either increased or decreased the likelihood of confusing the two pulse rates. in addition to affording an assay of signal robustness, this paradigm made it possible to gauge how subjects judgments were influenced by successive ipis. logistic regression revealed a strong primacy effect: subjects decisions were disproportionately influenced by a trials initial ipis. response times and parameter estimates from drift diffusion modeling showed that information accumulates more rapidly with bimodal stimulation than with either unimodal stimulus alone. analysis of error rates within each condition suggested consistently optimal decision making, even with increased ipi variability. finally, beat information delivered by vibrotactile signals proved just as robust as information conveyed by visual signals, confirming vibrotactile stimulations potential as a communication channel.",0.39215686274509803,0.06564551422319474,0.20865493431819962

"Ubiquitous in biological systems and protein pharmaceuticals, isoaspartic acid (isoAsp, isoD or  Asp) in peptides and proteins arises from either deamidation of asparagine (Asn) or isomerization of aspartic acid (Asp) via a common succinimide intermediate, as depicted in .

Indeed, as we report herein, low abundant (as low as 0.5 %) isoAsp in beta amyloid (A) and cytochrome c peptides are detected and quantified, even when isoAsp and Asp peptides are co eluted.a ubiquitous yet underappreciated protein post translational modification, isoaspartic acid (isoasp, isod or asp), generated via the deamidation of asparagine or isomerization of aspartic acid in proteins, plays a diverse and crucial role in ageing, as well as autoimmune, cancer, neurodegeneration and other diseases. in addition, formation of isoasp is a major concern in protein pharmaceuticals, as it may lead to aggregation or activity loss. the scope and significance of isoasp have, up to now, not been fully explored, as an unbiased screening of isoasp at low abundance remains challenging.

"The first desulfurization, corresponding to cysteine to dehydroalanine conversion, was associated with the known heat and alkaline induced  elimination of disulfide bridges. In this paper, we have examined the above two desulfurization reactions of cysteine in the context of sample handling for MS protein characterization in order to provide insight into proper sample preparation protocols. In addition, we examined a thiyl radical based mechanism for the conversion of cysteine to alanine .In contrast to DTT, heating the peptide with TCEP led to the formation of a new modification corresponding to the loss of 32 Da , suggesting conversion of cysteine to alanine. Based on this result, the mechanism of conversion of cysteine to alanine is clearly different from that of elimination . Presumably, this ion corresponds to the loss of 34 Da from one of atriopeptin peptides, i.e., conversion of cysteine to dehydroalanine that was generated during the tryptic digestion by heat induced  elimination.The goal of this paper was to examine cysteine modifications induced during the sample preparation for protein characterization, specifically the conversion of cysteine to dehydroalanine for example during disulfide mapping; and cysteine to alanine when heating with TCEP. Specifically, we examined two modifications, i.e. conversion of cysteine to dehydroalanine and cysteine to alanine, caused by sample preparation.

"BP treatments were found to increase the microcrack density without altering the average length of the cracks . A non linear fracture model for simulation of failure of cancellous bone was employed by . Our present study employs a non linear fracture mechanics model to study failure of trabecular bone.In the animal model, both BP and SERM treatment lead to increase in trabecular bone modulus EB and trabecular bone strength B. These findings suggest that methods of non linear fracture mechanics are necessary to understand the failure process of interest. Nevertheless, several trends on bone failure can still be inferred .It can then be argued that BPs are effective in such a scenario because they increase the load carrying capability of the weakest link in the bone overall while SERMs would not provide such an effect. However, this mechanism in BPs would only be effective as long as the thinnest trabeculae can be considered as mechanically small structures, and points towards the potential existence of a critical trabecular width beyond which a treatment with BPs would be effective while SERMs would not affect bone load carrying capability.

The latter and other researchers have shown that estimation and inference are affected whether the data have been collected from To date, this multidisciplinary literature and, more importantly, the commercial software programs that have been developed to analyze cluster randomized data, do not provide measures like Pearsons r to assess the strength of association.The literature on the analysis of familial data is relevant to the present study because it demonstrates that researchers have not been able to derive suitable closed form expressions for the maximum likelihood estimator of an interclass or intraclass correlation coefficient when the number of elements in each cluster varies . Examples from prevention literature include the number of students within each randomized school and the number of patients seen by a participating physician who has been randomized to a study condition. Finally, the literature on the analysis of familial data has shown that some iterative or computer intensive approach will be required if a prevention researcher wants to obtain point and interval estimates of a correlation coefficient when the data were obtained with a cluster randomized design and cluster sizes vary .With the present case study, we sought to demonstrate how straightforward it would be to use a nonparametric bootstrap to obtain an interval estimate of Pearsons r with cluster randomized data and test the null hypothesis that there was no association between 5th grade students positive substance use expectancies and their intention to use substances in the coming weekend. However, the present study illustrates that even one outlier can be problematic when prevention researchers use a nonparametric bootstrap with cluster randomized data and there are relatively few clusters .

"Ultrasound (US) induced cell membrane porosity, or sonoporation, has shown its unique potential in intracellular drug and gene delivery via generation of non specific openings or pores on the cell membrane. We have previously demonstrated the feasibility of using the voltage clamp technique to monitor the dynamic sonoporation process in real time . An electro diffusion model was developed to relate the radius of a single pore with the TMC so that the size of a single pore was estimated from the recorded TMC.Below we describe the design of experimental condition to ensure generation of a single pore in our study . Assuming that each pore is generated by one bubble, the probability of having N pores (by N porating bubbles) on the membrane is described by a Poisson distribution  (1)f(N;)=Ne/N!, where  is the mean value of the number of pores.

"Following work initiated by , and pursued in , the present comparative study attempts to alleviate these problems using the same sample selection criteria and performing the same statistical methods in three historical populations: The Registre de la population du Qubec ancien at the Universit de Montral, the BALSAC database at the Universit du Qubec  Chicoutimi, and the Utah Population Database at the University of Utah. In such conditions, there are very few intentional checks on reproduction, and if increased fertility reduces the chances for survival to old ages, higher postreproductive mortality rates should be observed among highly fertile women. The article concludes on the advantages of comparative approaches.Note again the similarity of the coefficients for the three samples of cohorts. Provided that our model is correct, we may infer that selection does not fundamentally alter the results of our Gompertz survival model as all effects remain in the same direction. Yet, most effect sizes increase with the introduction of IMR, just as one would expect for any survival model that adds some relevant predictors .frontier populations provide exceptional opportunities to test the hypothesis of a trade off between fertility and longevity. in such populations, mechanisms favoring reproduction usually find fertile ground, and if these mechanisms reduce longevity, demographers should observe higher postreproductive mortality among highly fertile women. we test this hypothesis using complete female reproductive histories from three large demographic databases: the registre de la population du qubec ancien (universit de montral), which covers the first centuries of settlement in quebec; the balsac database (universit du qubec chicoutimi), including comprehensive records for the saguenay lac st jean (slsj) in quebec in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries; and the utah population database (university of utah), including all individuals who experienced a vital event on the mormon trail and their descendants.",PMC6121733.json,"frontier populations provide exceptional opportunities to test the hypothesis of a trade off between fertility and longevity. in such populations, mechanisms favoring reproduction usually find fertile ground, and if these mechanisms reduce longevity, demographers should observe higher postreproductive mortality among highly fertile women. we test this hypothesis using complete female reproductive histories from three large demographic databases: the registre de la population du qubec ancien (universit de montral), which covers the first centuries of settlement in quebec; the balsac database (universit du qubec chicoutimi), including comprehensive records for the saguenay lac st jean (slsj) in quebec in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries; and the utah population database (university of utah), including all individuals who experienced a vital event on the mormon trail and their descendants. together, the three samples allow for comparisons over time and space, and represent one of the largest set of natural fertility cohorts used to simultaneously assess reproduction and longevity. using survival analyses, we found a negative influence of parity and a positive influence of age at last child on postreproductive survival in the three populations, as well as a significant interaction between these two variables. the effect sizes of all these parameters were remarkably similar in the three samples. however, we found little evidence that early fertility affects postreproductive survival. the use of heckmans procedure assessing the impact of mortality selection during reproductive ages did not appreciably alter these results. we conclude our empirical investigation by discussing the advantages of comparative approaches. am. j. hum. biol. 21:533540, 2009.",0.6726943942133816,0.49001814882032674,0.5162726261145356

"Thus, a strategy for varying the performance of MAP estimators is still needed. Such a strategy is essential for several reasons: 1) the MAP cost function may be more appropriate in certain classification tasks than the MPM cost function,many estimation tasks require bayesian classifiers capable of adjusting their performance (e.g. sensitivity/specificity). in situations where the optimal classification decision can be identified by an exhaustive search over all possible classes, means for adjusting classifier performance, such as probability thresholding or weighting the a posteriori probabilities, are well established. thus, a strategy for varying the performance of map estimators is still needed.Specifically, they identify the MAP and MPM estimates of the same random variable X (see Section 3.1). Both the MAP and MPM cost functions weight each class equally. Specifically, we present the multiplicative weighted MAP (MWMAP) and MPM (MWMPM) estimation criteria .",PMC3508385.json,"many estimation tasks require bayesian classifiers capable of adjusting their performance (e.g. sensitivity/specificity). in situations where the optimal classification decision can be identified by an exhaustive search over all possible classes, means for adjusting classifier performance, such as probability thresholding or weighting the a posteriori probabilities, are well established. unfortunately, analogous methods compatible with markov random fields (i.e. large collections of dependent random variables) are noticeably absent from the literature. consequently, most markov random field (mrf) based classification systems typically restrict their performance to a single, static operating point (i.e. a paired sensitivity/specificity). to address this deficiency, we previously introduced an extension of maximum posterior marginals (mpm) estimation that allows certain classes to be weighted more heavily than others, thus providing a means for varying classifier performance. however, this extension is not appropriate for the more popular maximum a posteriori (map) estimation. thus, a strategy for varying the performance of map estimators is still needed. such a strategy is essential for several reasons: 1) the map cost function may be more appropriate in certain classification tasks than the mpm cost function, 2) the literature provides a surfeit of map estimation implementations, several of which are considerably faster than the typical markov chain monte carlo methods used for mpm, and 3) map estimation is used far more often than mpm. consequently, in this paper we introduce multiplicative weighted map (mwmap) estimation achieved via the incorporation of multiplicative weights into the map cost function which allows certain classes to be preferred over others. this creates a natural bias for specific classes, and consequently a means for adjusting classifier performance. similarly, we show how this multiplicative weighting strategy can be applied to the mpm cost function (in place of the strategy we presented previously), yielding multiplicative weighted mpm (mwmpm) estimation. furthermore, we describe how mwmap and mwmpm can be implemented using adaptations of current estimation strategies such as iterated conditional modes and mpm monte carlo. to illustrate these implementations, we first integrate them into two separate mrf based classification systems for detecting carcinoma of the prostate (cap) on 1) digitized histological sections from radical prostatectomies and 2) t2 weighted tesla ex vivo prostate mri. to highlight the extensibility of mwmap and mwmpm to estimation tasks involving more than two classes, we also incorporate these estimation criteria into a mrf based classifier used to segment synthetic brain mr images. in the context of these tasks, we show how our novel estimation criteria can be used to arbitrarily adjust the sensitivities of these systems, yielding receiver operator characteristic curves (and surfaces).",0.46874999999999994,0.37282229965156793,0.3755908533308554

"Accordingly, AAV1 hrGFP was convected into corona radiata, striatum, and basal forebrain. In the course of our experiments, we detected a strong cell mediated response against AAV1 hrGFP in target brain regions, as well as a humoral response against both hrGFP and AAV1 capsid. This response probably arose from transduction of nonneuronal antigen presenting cells by the vector.Animals were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (25 mg/kg, intravenous) and killed 4 weeks after AAV1 hrGFP administration. Fixed brain slices were cut into 40 m coronal sections with a cryostat. To evaluate the cell types transduced, sections were processed for fluorescence immunostaining with various markers.We have explored in nonhuman primates the utility of this serotype with a vector that encodes a humanized Renilla green fluorescent protein (hrGFP) for which the codon usage has been optimized for use in mammals (see patent WO/2004/005322). Our goal was to use this GFP as a marker of cellular transduction to elucidate the types of cells transduced in different parts of the brain, to understand more about how AAV1 is trafficked within and beyond infused brain regions, and to assess the potential safety issues of a vector exhibiting broader tropism than AAV2 .

"This is particularly prominent in the first several months posttransplant and in patients having received T cell depleted grafts (eg, in vivo with antithymocyte globulin or ex vivo by CD34 cell enrichment of the graft). This suggests that in the first several months posttransplant the diversity of T cells is severely restricted, and that it takes at least 2 years to restore the diversity to normal. However, the skewed V representation by flow cytometry or spectratyping may also reflect expansion of certain T cell clones rather than restricted T cell diversity.Three individuals were studied: a 46 year old female with systemic sclerosis (SSc) undergoing autologous CD34 cell transplantation using conditioning with cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg), total body irradiation (TBI) (8 Gy) and antithymocyte globulin (ATG) (90 mg/kg), a 28 year old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) undergoing autologous CD34 cell transplantation using the same conditioning, and a healthy 44 year old male (control).

"Notwithstanding these epidemiological relationships, few studies have provided a mechanistic understanding of how early glucocorticoid exposure leads to metabolic or cardiovascular dysfunction.

Accordingly, we evaluated the effects of DEX exposure of neonatal rats in two treatment periods, postnatal days (PN) 13 and 79, bracketing stages of development in the rat that are equivalent to those in second to early third trimester human fetuses, the stage in which glucocorticoid use is recommended for preterm infants ; we focused on doses within the therapeutic range (0.2 or 0.8 mg/kg) as well as a much lower dose (0.05 mg/kg) likely to be more representative of stress related glucocorticoid actions.However, the dose effect relationship was distinctly different from that seen in the liver, with a large increase obtained at the lowest dose and a progressive loss of effect as the dose was raised.

"One way the binding of a drug at a particular site on HSA can be identified is by determining if this drug has direct competition with a specific probe for that site. The purpose of this study is to examine several compounds that are closely related to warfarin in structure with the goal of determining if these might be used as alternative probes for Sudlow site I in drug protein binding studies. The data obtained in this study should also provide clues as to how the various structural features of warfarin and related coumarin compounds contribute to their binding to Sudlow site I .The detection wavelengths used in the competition studies were as follows: coumarin, 277 nm; 7 hydroxycoumarin, 325 nm; 7 hydroxy 4 methylcoumarin, 325 nm; and 4 hydroxycoumarin, 286 nm.

"To our knowledge, no reports have examined the effects of CS on both myocardial structure and signal transduction pathways such as mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs), which govern cell survival and growth in the myocardium. These latter extracellular signals activate MAPKs, such as extracellular regulated kinase (ERK1/2), p38 kinase (p38) and c Jun NH2terminal protein kinase (JNK). Furthermore, we measured urinary levels of NE, since CS exposure in humans is associated with increased NE levels and NE is associated with the activation of MAPKs.CS induces the secretion of different types of circulating neurohumoral stimuli, such as NE, that are linked to MAPK activation. Similar to NE, TNF is a potent activator of MAPKs; therefore, in future studies, it would be important to determine if TNF serum and/or myocardial tissues levels are increased after CS. Second, because we measured MAPK activation and structural and functional parameters of LV remodelling at the same time point and did not attempt to inhibit MAPK activation, we cannot conclude that CS induced activation of MAPK leads to cardiac remodelling.No significant ultrastructural changes were found in either group .

"In general, a challenge of Genome Wide Association studies (GWAS) is linking the observed genotype to phenotype associations with the molecular mechanisms that drive the associations (see Sedor and Freedman, introduction to this seminar in nephrology issue ,).

Finally, we discuss how these strategies can be used in an integrative manner to generate more extensive and definitive mechanistic information .The premise underlying analysis of gene expression and GWAS datasets is that renal disease phenotypes manifest renal tissue specific changes in transcript regulation, and so the integration of mRNA expression from renal tissue will help focus the analysis. Therefore, in this setting, we can use differential expression between diseased and unaffected tissue to identify regulatory pathways and transcriptional mechanisms in a disease and tissue specific manner . First, disease candidate transcripts are screened for their expression in renal tissue compartments.The integration of gene expression with disease GWAS is an important strategy to deciphering the regulatory mechanisms leading to disease phenotypes.

"A complementary view is that while face processing may be impervious to attentional influences during early stages of sensoriperceptual analysis, attention may influence later face processing. We presented participants with superimposed images of faces and scenes (; ; ) during ERP recording and directed their attention to the face or the scene.

After a brief review of the Siglec receptor family, Siglec 8 and Siglec F function on human eosinophils, and Siglec 8 function on mast cells, will be covered, followed by a discussion of their shared glycan ligands and known in vivo biology .Siglec 8 on human eosinophils and mast cells, and Siglec F on murine eosinophils, are functionally related inhibitory receptors * 19178537 Siglec 8 was originally discovered from a human eosinophil cDNA library prepared from a patient of this author with hypereosinophilic syndrome. Additional independent work using a comparative transcriptome approach has confirmed the highly selective nature of Siglec 8 expression by eosinophils . When monoclonal antibodies to the extracellular region of Siglec 8 were generated, prominent and selective expression of Siglec 8 on human eosinophils was confirmed [, ], but, somewhat surprisingly, Siglec 8 was also found to be expressed on human mast cells and to a weak but consistent degree on human basophils  .Engagement of Siglec 8 and its closest functional paralog in the mouse, Siglec F, on eosinophils in vitro and in vivo result in profound and selective apoptosis.

"Our previous work has suggested that clarithromycin is a good candidate for treating invasive pathogens because it is accumulated inside gingival fibroblasts and epithelial cells. Azithromycin and clarithromycin are effective against A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis. We hypothesized that PMNs and HL 60 cells (a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line that can be induced into immature PMN like cells) possess similar active transport systems that facilitate intracellular accumulation of clarithromycin.PMNs were isolated from citrated whole blood, using Ficoll/Hypaque density gradient centrifugation and dextran sedimentation. Cells isolated in this manner are generally >99% PMNs (based on cytospin preparations stained with Wright Giemsa) and >99% viable (based on trypan blue exclusion). PMNs were suspended in Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) at densities of 5  106 cells/ml and 107 cells/ml, respectively, for the transport assays and phagocytic killing assays described below .Our results support the hypothesis that undifferentiated HL 60 cells, differentiated HL 60 cells, and mature peripheral blood PMNs possess a similar active transport system for clarithromycin.

"The stomate is one such natural opening in the plant epidermis and has long been recognized as a major point of entry for plant pathogenic bacteria . Melotto and colleagues noted that plant stomata close in response to a plant pathogen, Pseudomonas syringae pv. This observation suggests that bacterium triggered stomatal closure is an output of PAMP triggered immunity .Escherichia coli O157:H7 apparently cannot overcome stomatal closure in Arabidopsis leaves, resulting in constitutive activation of the stomatal immune response . However, a recent study documented a remarkable ability of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (STM) to migrate toward stomata and enter plant tissues without triggering stomatal immune response . It is not known whether the inability of STM to trigger stomatal closure is because PAMPs produced by STM are not recognizable by stomatal guard cells or because, like some plant pathogens, STM produces a factor that actively suppresses PAMP induced stomatal closure.As discussed in this review, stomata represent a major route of pathogen invasion and recent studies have begun to shed light on the signal transduction cascades underlying bacterial regulation of stomatal closure and opening. Because stomata respond to both abiotic and biotic signals, pathogens may exploit abiotic environmental conditions, such as high humidity, and/or produce virulence factors to actively suppress stomatal closure as part of their infection strategy. In the future, it would be important to learn about the detailed molecular and biochemical mechanisms by which PAMP, SA, and ABA signaling cascades intersect each other at the molecular level and to elucidate how different pathogen virulence factors inhibit stomatal closure.",PMC2946497.json,"stomata are microscopic pores formed by pairs of guard cells in the epidermis of terrestrial plants; they are essential for gas exchange with the environment and controlling water loss. accordingly, plants regulate stomatal aperture in response to environmental conditions, such as relative humidity, co2 concentration, and light intensity. stomatal openings are also a major route of pathogen entry into the plant and plants have evolved mechanisms to regulate stomatal aperture as an immune response against bacterial invasion. in this review, we highlight studies that begin to elucidate signaling events involved in bacterium triggered stomatal closure and discuss how pathogens may have exploited environmental conditions or, in some cases, have evolved virulence factors to actively counter stomatal closure to facilitate invasion.",0.41578947368421054,0.13756613756613756,0.2813611358078797

"Fung's quasi linear viscoelastic (QLV) theory is a widely used viscoelastic model that provides meaningful phenomenological fit coefficients and has previously been applied to many biological soft tissues, including the plantar soft tissue. Thus, the purpose of this study was to characterize the viscoelastic behavior of both diabetic and non diabetic plantar tissue at relevant locations beneath the foot using approaches based on previous implementations of the QLV theory as well as several parameters measured directly from the raw relaxation data since the fitting process is a potential source of error. These properties are essential to fully understand the role, if any, that viscoelastic property changes play in ulcer formation in diabetic patients and to take necessary measures to prevent amputation in this predisposed populace .Linear mixed effects regression was used to assess differences in stress relaxation coefficients and raw data parameters by condition (diabetic vs. non diabetic) or plantar location (calcaneus vs. other).

"First responder research predominantly targets police officers (e.g. ; ), firefighters (e.g. ), search and rescue personnel such as those in National Guard services (e.g. ), ambulance personnel (emergency medical technicians and paramedics; e.g. ) and military personnel .

A Model of First responder Coping: An Approach/Avoidance BifurcationThe present study highlights multiple pathways for first responders to increase their well being in the face of work stress. Firstly, it indicates the numerous areas for intervention, while also noting that an integrative philosophy, involving both approach and avoidance coping strategies, physical health behaviours and methods of seeking social support could prove most beneficial.

There are reports from clinical practice in different long chain fatty acid oxidation defects demonstrating prevention of muscle weakness and pain and also episodes of rhabdomyolysis with medium chain triglyceride (MCT) supplementation right prior to exercise providing sufficient energy during increased energy demand .As reviewed here the mouse models representing a range of enzyme deficiencies in the FAO pathway have been instrumental in our further understanding of the pathophysiology of these disorders in human patients. They called this genetic hypothesis synergistic heterozygosity. That is, individuals with two different heterozygous enzyme deficiencies in the same metabolic pathway (mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation) will be at risk for acute metabolic disease.

"The occurrence of both anger and sad expressions in response to the same goal blockage context and within the same individuals is consistent with findings from studies of facial expression during infancy and is of interest in light of recent work on the biphasic structure of children's tantrums. The goal blockage responses of young infants, like the tantrums of toddlers may involve both anger and sad emotion processes. To test our hypotheses, mothers and their 4 to 5 month old infants were seen initially in the laboratory for assessment of goal blockage responses.Infants participated in a standard contingency learning/goal blockage procedure. We videotaped infants' facial expressions throughout the entire procedure. Following coding, infants were assigned into goal blockage groups based on the pattern of anger or sad expression observed during the goal blockage.Preliminary analyses established that there were initially no differences in the goal blockage response of boys and girls overall or by emotion goal blockage group. The median age of tantrum onset for those children who had reportedly displayed tantrums on the 12 month questionnaire was 52 weeks.

"Within sex work environments, FSWs are exposed to multiple work related harms (sex work harms hereafter), such as violence, alcohol and drug dependency, stigmatisation and discrimination, debt, criminalisation and exploitation , which potentially can increase transmission of HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) . These sex work harms are context specific, with risk and vulnerability shaped by variations in sex work structures, especially in the thriving sex industry in China. Empirical data on the effects of these harms on HIV risk among FSWs are, however, limited (Pirkle et al. 2007).female sex workers (fsws) in china are exposed to multiple work related harms that increase hiv vulnerability. sex work harms were assessed by property stolen, being underpaid or not paid at all, verbal and sexual abuse, forced drinking; and forced sex more than once. mommies protection moderated the effect of sex work harms on unprotected sex with clients.These interdependent relationships of profit and workers safety indicate that these sex work structures, which have a vested profit interest, can also be used as social capital for HIV prevention intervention . Whilst the mobilisation of FSWs could be an effective way to reduce HIV risk factors, this seems to be unlikely in China due to the criminalisation of sex work.

"Because the alphaviruses (Togaviridae, Alphavirus) are mostly transmitted by mosquitoes , in most situations these viruses do not have the ecological potential to be maintained in the adult vectors for extended periods. The swallow bug (Hemiptera: Cimicidae: Oeciacus vicarius Horvath) is the only known vector for Buggy Creek virus (BCRV), an alphavirus in the western equine encephalomyelitis virus (WEEV) complex (, , , , ). Swallow bugs transmit BCRV to their avian hosts, the cliff swallow (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota Vieillot) and the house sparrow (Passer domesticus L.; , ), during blood meal acquisition.Swallow bugs clustering at the entrances of abandoned, intact cliff swallow nests were collected from site NN (from all nests) when it was inactive on 9 May 2004, 31 May 2004, and 14 May 2005 and from site CS (from about half the nests) on 24 May 2009 by brushing the bugs into a wide mouthed collecting jar.

Neither prevalence nor viral RNA concentrations in the unfed bug pools differed from those for bugs at active sites, suggesting no reduction in the number of infected bugs per pool with time .

"One such molecule is trypanothione, a unique diglutathionyl spermidine conjugate found in kinetoplastids within the suborder Trypanosomatida . Trypanosomes are extremely resistant to ionizing radiation and oxidative stress at least in part through the molecular physiology of the trypanothione molecule ( ). As a polyamine dithiol, trypanothione is reminiscent of man made polyamine thiol radioprotectors such as amifostine.Transgenic Biosynthesis of Trypanothione Protects Escherichia coli from Radiation Induced Toxicity The T. cruzi expression plasmids encoding trypanothione synthetase, pET15b TcTryS (Ampr), and trypanothione reductase, pBRT, were a generous gift from Dr. Alan Fairlamb (University of Dundee, Scotland) (, ). To induce expression of recombinant TS and TR for HPLC analysis of trypanothione, Bl21 E. coli transformed with pETA/TS and pETK/TR were grown to an optical density (OD) at 600 nm of ~1.2; the culture was then cooled, induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl  d 1 thiolgalactopyranoside (IPTG), and grown at 25C at 100 rpm for 16 h. Alternatively, for nickel column purification and all irradiation experiments, transformed E. coli was induced in log phase with growth normalized to an OD of 0.6.After demonstrating that transgenic TS and TR expression could be established in E. coli, we next confirmed that trypanothione was generated in this system. Next we measured the frequency of radiation induced DNA lesions by examining the integrity of the E. coli chromosome in trypanothione expressing bacteria. Expression of trypanothione inhibited bacterial DNA damage after ionizing radiation and decreased the frequency of E. coli chromosome breakage by ~4.3 fold in irradiated bacteria expressing trypanothione compared to control E. coli .",PMC2942016.json,"trypanothione is a unique diglutathionyl spermidine conjugate found in abundance in trypanosomes but not in other eukaryotes. because trypanothione is a naturally occurring polyamine thiol reminiscent of the synthetic drug amifostine, it may be a useful protector against radiation and oxidative stress. for these reasons we hypothesized that trypanothione might serve as a radioprotective agent when produced in bacteria. to accomplish this objective, the trypanothione synthetase and reductase genes from t. cruzi were introduced into e. coli and their expression was verified by qpcr and immunoblotting. trypanothione synthesis in bacteria, detected by hplc, resulted in decreased intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species as determined by h2dcfda oxidation. moreover, e. coli genomic dna was protected from radiation induced dna damage by 4.6 fold in the presence of trypanothione compared to control bacteria. concordantly, the transgenic e. coli expressing trypanothione were 4.3 fold more resistant to killing by 137cs radiation compared to e. coli devoid of trypanothione expression. thus we have shown for the first time that e. coli can be genetically engineered to express the trypanothione biosynthetic pathway and produce trypanothione, which results in their radioresistance. these results warrant further research to explore the possibility of developing trypanothione as a novel radioprotective agent.",0.4870689655172414,0.17316017316017315,0.2832539927379614

"For example, horseshoe crabs from semidiurnal environments (two approximately equal tides per day, every 12.4 h) express tidal rhythms of locomotion that are synchronized to the tides in their native regions .

"Classification of rodent sleep and wakefulness using electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) recordings has traditionally been a time intensive manual task.

If the dimensionality is reduced to three using factor analysis such as principal component analysis (PCA), the clusters may be shown visually in a three dimensional (3 D) scatterplot and the classification may be performed by hand.To test the method, separate 24 hour EEG/EMG recordings from 10 adult male Sprague Dawley rats were scored by four human raters: two using traditional epoch by epoch manual scoring and two using the new PCA space scoring. After recovery and adaption, one channel of EEG and one channel of EMG were recorded from each rat for a 24 hour period. These seven features were collected into a feature matrix for each 24 hour recording.In summary, the PCA space method is a novel way to quickly classify sleep and wakefulness in rat recordings.

The electrochemical stripping detection involved a 1 min pretreatment at +0.6 V, and 2 min electrodeposition at 1.4 V, and stripping from 1.3 V to 0.3 V using a square wave voltammetric waveform, with a 5 mV potential step, a 25 Hz frequency and an amplitude of 25 mV.In conclusion, we described the synthesis of a novel class of compositionally encoded electrochemical QD barcodes based on the reverse micelle approach. Different encoding metal ions (Zn2+, Cd2+, Pb2+) were confined in one single nanoparticle by using the reverse micelle approach. The application of these barcodes as tags in sensitive immunoassays of CEA was also demonstrated.",PMC2836120.json,"reproducible electrochemically encoded quantum dot (qd) barcodes were prepared by using the reverse micelle synthetic approach. the encoding elements, zn2+, cd2+, pb2+ were confined within a single qd, which eliminates the cumbersome encapsulation process used by other common nanoparticle based barcode preparation schemes. the distinct voltammetric stripping patterns of zn2+, cd2+, pb2+ at distinguishable potentials with controllable current intensities offer excellent encoding capability for the prepared electrochemical (ec) qds. additionally, the simultaneous modification of the qd barcode surface with organic ligands during the preparation process make them potentially useful in biomedical research. for proof of concept of their application in bioassays, the ec qd barcodes were further employed as tags for an immunoassay of a cancer marker, carcinoembryonic antigen (cea). the voltammetric stripping response of the dissolved bardcode tags was proportional to log[cea] in the range from 0.01 ng ml1 to ng ml1, with a detection limit of 3.3 pg ml1. the synthesized ec qd barcodes hold considerable potentials in biodetection, encrypted information and product tracking.",0.49638554216867475,0.1791767554479419,0.28046317520918873
"The majority of diarrheal illnesses are acute in duration (AD, <14 days); however, a subset of illnessesknown as persistent diarrhea (PD)begin acutely then persist 14 days or longer, thereby resulting in a disproportionate share of diarrhea related morbidity and mortality. Chief among these was the need to characterize prolonged episodes of acute diarrhea (ProD, duration 713 days) in order to further understand the pathogenesis and classification of PD, as well as the potential impact of interventions to halt the progression to persistent diarrhea.

"Some studies have found that among persons with psychotic illnesses, though not specifically schizophrenia, good premorbid functioning is associated with a lower risk for suicide attempts (; ; ). Thus, the association of premorbid functioning and suicide attempts remains unclear . In the present study, we examined the association of premorbid functioning to suicide attempts in a multi site cohort of first admission patients with psychotic disorders using a longitudinal design.Is Poor Premorbid Functioning a Risk Factor for Suicide Attempts in First Admission Psychosis? The association of premorbid functioning and suicide attempts prior to first hospital admission was examined with logistic regression. Cox regression analyses were used to examine whether poor premorbid functioning was associated with suicide attempts during the 48 month follow up period.In summary, the current epidemiologically based findings suggest that persons suffering from psychotic illness who had poor premorbid functioning are a very vulnerable group for suicide attempts. Taken together, it is suggested that persons with histories of suicide attempts and poor functioning prior to onset of illness should be carefully monitored for future suicide attempts, as they are 5.6 times more likely than those with good premorbid functioning and no previous attempts to have subsequent attempts .

"During the last half century, renal tumor size has been reported by multiple institutions to be significantly associated with risk of metastases both synchronous and asynchronous.  Additionally, autopsy data of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) suggests that risk of metastases is significantly associated with size of the primary tumor, albeit with a higher prevalence of metastases across all tumor sizes. This is also supported in the von Hippel Lindau literature where risk of metastases in patients with tumors less than 3cm was reported to be negligible.Associations between tumor size and M1 RCC were also evaluated with logistic regression models, entering tumor size as continuous, from which we plotted the risk of M1 RCC by tumor size.

"To address these limitations of RDL, we introduce, herein, a significantly improved cloning methodology Recursive Directional Ligation by Plasmid Reconstruction (PRe RDL)  to rapidly clone repetitive polypeptides of any sequence and length. In PRe RDL, two halves of a parent plasmid, each containing the desired oligomer, are ligated together, thereby dimerizing the oligomer and reconstituting a functional plasmid. The reconstitution of a functional plasmid only upon successful ligation in PRe RDL also addresses two the other limitations of RDL: the significant background from self ligation of the vector and the decreased efficiency due to circularization of the insert.The gene segment encoding a (CGG)8WP trailer (T1) was created by annealing two chemically synthesized oligonucleotides that encode this peptide sequence, as described previously (Monomer gene synthesis). The ligation of the plasmid encoding L1 to the ELP proceeded in a manner similar to a typical dimerization step in PRe RDL. The construction of the ELP1 60 L1T1 oligomer is shown in to illustrate the modular process by which a leader or trailer gene sequence can be appended to the 5 and 3 end of the oligomerized gene that encode for peptide sequences that are distinct from the repetitive polypeptide.This paper presents a straightforward and general method to rapidly produce a repetitive polypeptide of any desired sequence and length over a wide range of molecular weights. The key to this approach is to use type IIs restriction enzymes to produce seamless, head to tail repeats of any arbitrary DNA sequence by a process that requires reconstitution of the plasmid in every oligomerization step. This system is also flexible in that the genes for other, non repetitive peptide sequences can be appended at the two ends of the gene, which allows leader and trailer peptide sequences with unique functional groups to be incorporated at the two ends of a repetitive polypeptide .",PMC2862688.json,"this paper reports a new strategy, recursive directional ligation by plasmid reconstruction (pre rdl), to rapidly clone highly repetitive polypeptides of any sequence and specified length over a large range of molecular weights. in a single cycle of pre rdl, two halves of a parent plasmid, each containing a copy of an oligomer, are ligated together, thereby dimerizing the oligomer and reconstituting a functional plasmid. this process is carried out recursively to assemble an oligomeric gene with the desired number of repeats. pre rdl has several unique features that stem from the use of type iis restriction endonucleases: first, pre rdl is a seamless cloning method that leaves no extraneous nucleotides at the ligation junction. because it uses type iis endonucleases to ligate the two halves of the plasmid, pre rdl also addresses the major limitation of rdl in that it abolishes any restriction on the gene sequence that can be oligomerized. the reconstitution of a functional plasmid only upon successful ligation in pre rdl also addresses two other limitations of rdl: the significant background from self ligation of the vector observed in rdl, and the decreased efficiency of ligation due to nonproductive circularization of the insert. pre rdl can also be used to assemble genes that encode different sequences in a predetermined order to encode block copolymers or append leader and trailer peptide sequences to the oligomerized gene.",0.6319702602230483,0.38432835820895517,0.44273592431610326

"This is an underappreciated ethical challenge to the patient physician relationship: the need for an expansion of the concept of patient autonomy to include, not only decisional autonomy, but also the patients capacity to execute complex self management tasks, i.e., executive autonomy.

"In contrast to complex genetic diseases (such as diabetes) the single gene in a Mendelian disorder, such as autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), determines if the individual develops the disease. This complexity is seen at the genic level, where more than one gene causes ADPKD; several other genes are also associated with overlapping phenotypes. While we have a good understanding of the genes that cause ADPKD, we are only now getting a glimpse of the other genetic (and environmental) factors that fully influence how the disease manifests in an individual.Determinants of Renal Disease Variability in ADPKD 20219616 Although genetic and allelic effects can explain some of the phenotypic variability in ADPKD, it is likely that genetic factors elsewhere in the genome also play a significant role. Although the population data indicates that most missense changes are fully inactivating, recent studies indicate that a few may be hypomorphic, or incompletely penetrant alleles. The full extent to which hypomorphic alleles account for mild PKD1 (simple cysts?), modulate the disease variability seen in families, and give the appearance of a negative family history, is yet to be determined.Whether a patient develops ADPKD is simply due to if they have a pathogenic mutation in the PKD1 or PKD2 gene, however, the severity of disease behaves more like a complex trait. The gene mutated is a major determinant of severity of disease in ADPKD with a range of studies showing the PKD1 is a more severe disease. It has a higher incidence of hypertension and hematuria, with ESRD occurring on average 20 years earlier (54.3y, compared to 74y for PKD2), , , .",PMC2837603.json,"in common with other mendelian diseases, the presentation and progression of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (adpkd) varies widely in the population. the typical course is of adult onset disease with esrd in the 6th decade. however, a small proportion has adequate renal function into the 9th decade, whereas others present with enlarged kidneys as neonates. adpkd is genetically heterogeneous and the disease gene is a major determinant of severity; pkd1 on average is associated with esrd years earlier than pkd2. the majority of pkd1 and pkd2 mutations are likely fully inactivating, although recent studies indicate that some alleles retain partial activity, hypomorphic alleles. homozygotes for such alleles are viable and in combination with an inactivating allele can result in early onset disease. hypomorphic alleles and mosaicism may also account for some cases with unusually mild disease. the degree of phenotypic variation detected in families indicates that genetic background influences disease severity. genome wide association studies are planned to map common variants associated with severity. although adpkd is a simple genetic disease, fully understanding the phenotypic variability requires consideration of influences at the genic, allelic and genetic background level, and so ultimately is complex.",0.5485961123110151,0.1475054229934924,0.28862912588521905

Free floating immunohistochemistry for CD45 (Rat monoclonal, Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) and A (Rabbit polyclonal A1 16, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) were performed as described previously  .Both mouse IgG and IVIg injection reduced soluble A1 40 and A1 42 between the 3 and 7 day time points and showed a gradual increase between the 7 and 21 day time points, although this increase was less dramatic for the A1 40 than the anti A antibody group . In contrast to the M1 markers, we found that M2a associated genes (Arg1, IL 1Ra and YM1) were significantly decreased at the 3 day time point with anti A antibody and at the 7 day time point with mouse IgG and IVIg .

"Where it is not possible to explicitly model the information source or sink, the best compression algorithms attempt to extract the way information is organized in the data in an adaptive fashion in a sense learning the structure which allows for compression. The biological sequences themselves become the messages and information theory and the data compression concepts become natural concepts for understanding the structures in these messages . Therefore, we provide only a brief survey of compression algorithms for biological sequences and focus more on their use as a measure of distance between biological sequences.Data Compression Concepts and Algorithms and their Applications to Bioinformatics 20157640 The major focus of bioinformatics is on three kinds of molecules, DNA, RNA, and proteins, all of which can be represented as sequences. The DNA molecule can be represented as a sequence by representing each nucleotide by the first letter of the corresponding nucleobase (T, A, C, and G) and writing the representation from the 5 to the 3 direction. Thus, the DNA molecule is redundant; each strand contains all the information necessary to construct the other strand.The concepts behind data compression have been very useful in understanding how information is organized in a number of signals used in multimedia communications. Reviewing the wide variety of places where these concepts have been useful it is difficult to escape the feeling that information theory, in particular those aspects of it that relate to data compression, are somehow organic to the area of bioinformatics.

"The arithmetic mean number of ligands is the most widely used parameter to characterize the distribution of ligand nanoparticle components per particle. Although defining the ligand nanoparticle composition by the arithmetic mean is an accepted standard of practice, this single value is insufficient to understand the material composition and ultimately predict the material activity. Our efforts in characterizing and defining ligand nanoparticle distributions have been greatly facilitated by two ligand nanoparticle systems for which the distribution of components can be resolved by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).As described above, batches of material with consistent ligand means can have very different distributions. These can be caused by small changes in the starting material, mass transport conditions and reaction kinetics. The Azide and Alkyne ligands can be temporarily substituted for functional ligands when the actual ligand nanoparticle distribution cannot be directly resolved.our work has been enabled by a model system using poly(amidoamine) dendrimers and two small molecule ligands. additionally, our experimental data has provided examples of material batches with the same mean ligand/nanoparticle ratio and very different distributions. we further found that distribution profiles can be highly sensitive to the synthetic history of the starting material as well as slight changes in reaction conditions.",PMC3217083.json,"conspectus nanoparticles conjugated with functional ligands are expected to have a major impact in medicine, photonics, sensing, and nanoarchitecture design. one major obstacle to realizing the promise of these materials, however, is the difficulty in controlling the ligand/nanoparticle ratio. this obstacle can be segmented into three key areas: first, many system designs have failed to account for the true heterogeneity of ligand/nanoparticle ratios that compose each material. second, the field's accepted level of characterization of ligand nanoparticle materials is deficient as it does not provide an accurate definition of material composition that is necessary to both understand the material property relationships as well as to monitor the consistency of the material. in particular, many characterization assays only determine the mean ligand/nanoparticle ratio and do not provide the number and relative amount of the different ligand/nanoparticle ratios that compose a material. third, some synthetic approaches that are presently in use may not produce consistent material as they are sensitive to reaction kinetics, and the synthetic history of the nanoparticle. in this account we describe the recent advances that we have made in understanding the material composition of ligand nanoparticle systems. our work has been enabled by a model system using poly(amidoamine) dendrimers and two small molecule ligands. using reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography (hplc) we have successfully resolved and quantified the relative amount of each ligand/dendrimer ratio present. this type of information is rare for the entire field of ligand nanoparticle materials because most analytical techniques have been unable to identify the components in the distribution. our experimental data indicates that the actual distribution of ligand nanoparticle components is much more heterogeneous than commonly assumed. the mean ligand/nanoparticle ratio that is so often the only information known about a material is insufficient. this is because the mean does not provide information on the diversity of components in the material and often does not describe the most common component (the mode). additionally, our experimental data has provided examples of material batches with the same mean ligand/nanoparticle ratio and very different distributions. this discrepancy indicates that the mean cannot be used as the sole metric to assess the reproducibility of a system. we further found that distribution profiles can be highly sensitive to the synthetic history of the starting material as well as slight changes in reaction conditions. we have incorporated the lessons from our experimental data into new systems designs to provide improved control over the ligand/nanoparticle ratios.",0.49759229534510435,0.2962962962962963,0.39766184197668836

"Comprehensive multivariate analyses of prognostic factors for the melanoma staging definition were again carried out by Cox regression model  . Although the Cox model has demonstrated its flexibility and usefulness in modeling survival data in melanoma, it also has inherent limitations due to its proportional hazard assumption and its inability to generate an explicit and flexible hazard function (, ). In this paper, we investigate several parametric models for melanoma prognosis and modeling and compared to the Cox model using a prospective melanoma research database established by the Melanoma Task Force of the AJCC.The Cox Snell residual plots of the GG model and the Cox model are shown in according to the substage of localized melanoma. The estimated survival functions of the GG model were compared with those generated by the Cox model and the Kaplan Meier method .

"Serial block face imaging is an image acquisition technique that has the potential to lead to three dimensional dynamic bone histomorphometry. Serial block face imaging involves repeatedly trimming off the top of a specimen and collecting images of the specimen blocks newly revealed cross section. Recently, Kazakia and colleagues demonstrated a technique for serial block face imaging implemented through fully automated serial milling .Three Dimensional Surface Texture Visualization of Bone Tissue Through Epifluorescence Based Serial Block Face Imaging 19772536 Serial block face imaging using epifluorescence is implemented using a serial milling device as described by Kazakia and colleagues . Images described below are collected using a 10X objective (0.7m/pixel). Alignment (registration) of each cross section in the stack is performed using fiduciary markers (vertical objects placed close to the specimen to allow more precise alignment for stacking).Iterative thresholding was particularly effective because it properly segmented noise and was capable of producing a segmentation in which the irregular surface texture resulting from remodeling activity was distinguishable from the rest of the bone . No significant differences in bone volume fraction or bone specific surface (the ratio of bone surface to total specimen volume) were observed among images at 0.7 m/pixel resolution.

"In addition, poverty related disparities in student functioning extend beyond achievement to rates of retention and out of school suspension, which are more common events for children from lower income households relative to their higher income peers  . To achieve our overarching goal, we include characteristics of children (i.e., academic and behavioral school readiness prior to kindergarten entry) and their environments (i.e., average cumulative risk from kindergarten through elementary school) to obtain clearer estimates of the contributions each has to child school success in 6th grade. We then turn to models of poverty and poverty related risk to place the events that may lead children to retention and suspension in middle childhood within a broader socioeconomic context.We examine early measures of student academic skills as well as their behavior problems prior to kindergarten entry as key predictors of their later risk for retention and OSS in the 6th grade, given that a robust literature documents remarkable stability in these domains across development. Exposure to high levels of cumulative risk in early childhood is associated with poorer educational outcomes, including decreases in student GPA and attendance through 12th grade and greater internalizing and externalizing behavior problems in adolescence . We expect that students exposed to higher levels of cumulative risk over time will have higher risk for retention and suspension in 6th grade, as potential initial school readiness will dissolve in the face of continued and considerable adversity.Our analyses clearly indicate that exposure to higher levels of poverty related cumulative risk was associated with increased risk a child would be retained and suspended in 6th grade. In this regard we are not surprised that students in our sample exposed to higher numbers of cumulative risk over time were more likely to be at risk for retention or OSS in 6th grade .

"Our objective was to evaluate the association between 21 SNPs (18 genes) across 7 radiation/platin pathways and serious treatment related toxicity in EAC patients who received cisplatin based RCT and surgery as part of a multicenter trial of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG). We focused on two toxicity endpoints: (1) acute radiation related, and (2) myelosuppression. We chose genes involved in platinum influx, efflux, and detoxification, as well as those involved in repairing cisplatin lesions through nucleotide excision repair (NER) or mismatch repair (MMR) and repairing radiation lesions through double stranded break repair (DSBR) and base excision repair (BER) .our objective was to evaluate the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) in radiation/platinum pathways and serious treatment related toxicity in subjects with esophageal adenocarcinoma who received cisplatin based preoperative radiochemotherapy. methods in a multicenter clinical trial (e1201), 81 eligible treatment nave subjects with resectable esophageal adenocarcinoma received cisplatin based chemotherapy concurrent with radiotherapy, with planned subsequent surgical resection. toxicity endpoints were defined as grade 3 radiation related or myelosuppressive events probably or definitely related to therapy, occurring during or up to 6 weeks following the completion of radiochemotherapy.For GST Pi Ile 105 Val, 0 of 21 subjects with AA (major homozygote) genotype had grade 34 radiation related toxicity, compared to 12 (31%) of 39 patients with GG or GA (variant) genotypes (, P = 0.005).

"Oxidative stress indicated by the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation and DNA damage occurred in a dose response fashion in brain tissues of rats after chronic exposure to PCB 126 (, ). This study was designed to investigate the possible modulation of the antioxidant enzyme activities and GSH level in the brain tissues of rats, in response to chronic exposure to the co planar congener PCB 126.

"During protein transport, large amounts of membranes and proteins move across the Golgi complex; despite this dynamic trafficking, Golgi membranes are able to maintain their structural identity. Screening of combinatorial libraries led to the identification of secramine (2), a small molecule that can block protein transport from Golgi to the plasma membrane, and CCL 19 (4), an agent that blocks the exit of proteins from Golgi and induces Golgi fragmentation. Inspired by these observations, we sought to characterize the cellular phenotype of norrisolide and explore its Golgi activity as a function of its structure.A third group of Golgi disturbing agents is represented by ilimaquinone (5) and norrisolide (7). Specifically, ilimaquinone (5) induces Golgi vesiculation by overstimulating Protein Kinase D (PKD), a protein required for Golgi membrane fission and production of secretory vesicles . At such temperature, protein transport is arrested at the level of the Golgi.We found that this natural product fragments Golgi membranes in an irreversible manner without affecting the microtubule cytoskeleton. This effect is distinctly different from that observed for ilimaquinone, a structurally related natural product that induces reversible Golgi fragmentation that is dependent on the activation of protein kinase D. Our studies also suggest that norrisolide induced Golgi fragments are able to receive secretory proteins from the ER but they cannot deliver them to the plasma membrane, indicating that this compound specifically blocks protein transport at the level of the Golgi apparatus. Structure activity studies indicate that the perhydroindane motif of norrisolide functions as the target recognition element, while the C19 acetoxy group is essential for the irreversibility of Golgi fragmentation.",PMC2838712.json,"the cellular activity of norrisolide (7), a novel golgi vesiculating agent, was dissected as function of its chemical structure. this natural product induces irreversible vesiculation of the golgi membranes and blocks protein transport at the level of the golgi. the golgi localization and fragmentation effects of depend on the presence of the perhydroindane core, while the irreversibility of fragmentation depends on the acetyl group of 7. we show that fluorescent derivatives of norrisolide are able to localize to the golgi apparatus and represent important tools for the study of the golgi structure and function.",0.42339832869080773,0.19607843137254902,0.309103855114154
"Consistent with this role of GABA ( aminobutyric acid), recent neuroimaging studies have shown that the modulation of cortical GABAergic activity is a key factor in human motor learning. GABA edited MEGA PRESS magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a noninvasive technique sensitive to the amount of GABA in tissue. We performed GABA edited MEGA PRESS MRS before and after training in a cohort of stroke patients undergoing two weeks of constraint induced movement therapy (CIMT).Despite no statistically significant changes in GABA levels between pre and posttraining across the group as a whole, there was a significant negative correlation between individual changes in GABA and motor improvement, unrelated to changes in GM content, during the 2 weeks of CIMT. We have previously shown that in a group of well recovered stroke patients inhibitory activity is decreased in motor cortex, but unlike in healthy subjects' no further decrease was seen in relation to training, possibly because of a lower limit for beneficial GABA decrease. A recently developed technique using MRS imaging of GABA could be of potential use in future studies exploring bihemispheric changes in GABA .The amount of GM within the voxel was similar between patients (34%) and healthy subjects (35%), and after correcting for GM volume, patients still had significantly lower GABA:Cr ratio, t(37) = 2.75, P < .01. After 2 weeks of training, patients improved significantly on the WMFT (for the 17 patients with complete MRS data sets, t(16) = 9.82, P < .001).

"Meaningful changes in UGS are reported to range from 0.1 m/s to 0.2 m/s  . A common approach is to use a stopwatch to manually time how long an individual takes to walk 4 m from a stationary start , although numerous variations have been reported [ ]. The purpose of this study was to use synchronous testing to explore the impact of tester on UGS assessment, and assess the influence of test repetition (trial 1 vs. 2), timing method (manual stopwatch vs. automated timing), and starting condition (stationary vs. dynamic start) on both UGS and fast gait speed (FGS) .Testing was performed by one of 13 testers trained by a single experienced researcher (S.J.W.) to follow the same procedure and script. The procedure was repeated to measure FGS with the instruction: I want you to walk as quickly, but as safely as you can without running. Time to walk 4 m from a stationary start (i.e. 0 m to 4 m) was simultaneously measured manually using a stopwatch and automatically via the timing gates positioned at 0 m and 4 m .

"We specifically focus on problems caused by misspecifying the model when not including direct effects of latent class predictors on the outcome in both approaches. This paper aims to provide recommendations for the inclusion of latent class predictors in regression mixture models.

While some studies argue that the one step approach results in more reliable parameter estimates , other studies argue that the three step approach more closely follows the logic of the typical latent class analyses. One of the benefits of using the three step approach over the one step approach is that the classification model does not make assumptions about class predictors.Only the correctly specified 1 step approach led to good latent class enumeration and parameter estimates in our simulations.

"Deficits of inhibitory control are common in autism spectrum disorder (ASD; ) and emerge as early as 24 months old . Based on prior findings that inhibitory control deficits become more pronounced in adolescence and early adulthood in ASD, we predicted that age associated increases in stopping ability and proactive RT slowing would be attenuated in ASD relative to controls. Lastly, we hypothesized that reduced stopping accuracy and proactive RT slowing would be associated with more severe RRBs in ASD .The relationships between age and stopping ability (Z=3.53, p<.001), age and RT slowing (Z=2.78, p=.01), and age and SSRT (Z=2.53, p=.01) were stronger for controls than patients .

Age moderated the relationship between RT slowing and stopping accuracy (r2=.10, F(1,193)=26.59, p<.001, f=.10).First, we found that inhibitory control deficits in ASD involve a reduced ability to proactively delay the onset of behavioral responses. Second, age related improvements in stopping ability were attenuated in ASD, which appears to be, in part, due to reduced rate of improvement in proactive slowing in patients beginning in early childhood.

"However, it still remains challenging for neonatal brain images, due to the low brain tissue contrast and poor spatial resolution as compared with adult brain images. Therefore, the segmentation results of the later time images can potentially serve as a subject specific tissue probabilistic atlas to guide the segmentation of the neonatal brain images from the same subject. In this paper, longitudinal MR images were employed to obtain a longitudinal subject specific atlas (with high local specificity) for performing accurate tissue segmentation for neonatal brain images.Brain Tissue Segmentation of Neonatal MR Images Using a Longitudinal Subject specific Probabilistic Atlas 20414458 To evaluate the proposed segmentation method, we applied it to a dataset of 10 neonates, each with the longitudinal T1 weighted MR images acquired at a mean gestational age of two weeks, one year old, and two years old. The manual segmentation was performed on the T2 weighted images, and the segmentation results are rigidly transformed to the T1 weighted images, for allowing the evaluation of tissue segmentation results on the T1 weighted images . Note that the central brain region, as shown in , was blocked in manual segmentation due to its low tissue contrast, and thus it is not included in the computation of the Dice ratio in our experiment.We presented a method for performing brain tissue segmentation of neonatal brain images by using a subject specific probabilistic atlas. This method takes advantage of the available longitudinal data in our study, i.e., using the segmentation results from the images acquired at a later time to guide the segmentation of the images acquired at earlier times. First, we are investigating an integrated method to combine the non rigid registration with tissue segmentation, particularly to use non rigid registration algorithms to align the subject specific atlas with the intermediate segmentation results at each iteration, aiming to improve the registration and segmentation performance simultaneously.",PMC2857333.json,"brain tissue segmentation of neonate mr images is a challenging task in study of early brain development, due to low signal contrast among brain tissues and high intensity variability especially in white matter. among various brain tissue segmentation algorithms, the atlas based segmentation techniques can potentially produce reasonable segmentation results on neonatal brain images. however, their performance on the population based atlas is still limited due to the high variability of brain structures across different individuals. moreover, it may be impossible to generate a reasonable probabilistic atlas for neonates without tissue segmentation samples. to overcome these limitations, we present a neonatal brain tissue segmentation method by taking advantage of the longitudinal data available in our study to establish a subject specific probabilistic atlas. in particular, tissue segmentation of the neonatal brain is formulated as two iterative steps of bias correction and probabilistic atlas based tissue segmentation, along with the guidance of brain tissue segmentation resulted from the later time images of the same subject which serve as a subject specific probabilistic atlas. the proposed method has been evaluated qualitatively through visual inspection and quantitatively by comparing with manual delineation results. experimental results show that the utilization of a subject specific probabilistic atlas can substantially improve tissue segmentation of neonatal brain images.",0.5447619047619048,0.25621414913957935,0.3093006963853285

"There is also uncertainty in our preexisting knowledge of that event  this is known as prior uncertainty.

Together these findings suggest fundamentally different representations by which prior and likelihood uncertainty in a decision making task map onto the human brain .Differential representations of prior and likelihood uncertainty in the human brain The uncertainty associated with the prior affects behavior . We found that areas more active with increased uncertainty in the prior include putamen, amygdala, insula, and OFC (p<0.05 whole brain corrected; family wise error (FWE) level; ). Likelihood uncertainty in our task thus seems to affect BOLD signal mainly in areas corresponding to the early stages of the visuomotor pathway .We found that greater prior uncertainty evoked increased brain activity in specialized brain areas that include the putamen, amygdala, OFC and parts of the insula. There are numerous reasons why the brain could use a strategy where prior uncertainty is processed in these specialized brain areas.

"To borrow famous typology for computational studies of the brain, decision scholars seemed for the first time poised to investigate decision making at the theoretical, algorithmic, and implementation levels simultaneously . In this review, we survey some of the scientific progress that has been made in these past seven years, focusing specifically on neurophysiological studies in primates and including closely related work in humans. Our aim is to provide one synthesis of the neurophysiology of decision making, as we understand it.Below, we review evidence that we interpret as suggesting that valuation involves the ventromedial sectors of the prefrontal cortex and associated parts of the striatum (likely as a final common path funneling information from many antecedent areas), while choice involves lateral prefrontal and parietal areas traditionally viewed as intermediate regions in the sensory motor hierarchy. Based on these data we argue that a basic model for primate decision making is emerging from recent investigations, which involves the coordinated action of these two circuits in a two stage algorithm . Although a fierce debate rages in economic circles about the validity and usefulness of because models, we take as a given for the purposes of this review that describing the mechanism of primate (both human and non human) decision making will yield new insights into behavior, just as studies of the primate visual system have revolutionized our understanding of perception .Neurophysiological investigations over the last seven years have begun to solidify the basic outlines of a neural mechanism for choice.

"Despite the availability of effective screening tests, CRC screening rates remain low, especially among minority populations. Thus, lack of provider recommendation among minority populations could contribute to the low screening rates in these populations. The purpose of the current study was to identify differences in the endorsement of barriers to CRC screening and to evaluate the association between provider recommendation and CRC screening adherence among Hispanic, Pacific Islander and White patients.Participants were asked to complete a self report questionnaire assessing barriers to, awareness of, and occurrence of provider recommendation for CRC screening. Provider recommendation for CRC screening was assessed by asking patients if their provider had ever discussed CRC options with them and if so, which option(s). The questionnaire also contained items assessing patient demographic information, including gender, age, race/ethnicity, and previous history of cancer.Similar to previous studies, commonly endorsed barriers included fear of test results, being unable to afford to leave work for screening appointments, being unaware of the need for colonoscopy, and lack of provider recommendation [, ]. Specifically, this study described barriers to CRC screening unique to Hispanic populations and addressed the lack of data on screening rates, barriers and provider CRC screening recommendation among Pacific Islander patients.

"Perhaps the simplest way to sample network activity using fluorescent indicators is by bath application of membrane permeant high affinity Ca2+ indicators that change fluorescence amplitude (such as Calcium Green AM or fluo 4 AM) to a slice preparation , which loads cells at or near the surface of the tissue sample , whose activity is recorded as a series of images . With these dyes, changes in fluorescence accompanying changes in intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) can be detected in the raw image series, and their salience can be enhanced by simple filtering, such as subtraction of the first image from the rest of the images in the series. We apply our methods to the activity of medullary networks responsible for respiratory rhythm generation, recorded in vitro from a neonate rat tilted slab preparation .In this image, fluorescence changes during Ca2+ influx are more salient, pixels within bright regions are still quite variable, with active regions showing up as going towards white (during Ca2+ influx) or towards black after return to baseline (arrows).

"Inhibiting the cell signaling pathways that regulate catabolic and anabolic activity would theoretically restore homeostasis in the joint and perhaps promote repair . MMP production is regulated by several signal transduction pathways, including those of the mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinases.

The no TMS block was included simply to demonstrate conclusively that in the absence of TMS, and before participants reported the absence of a phosphene, there was little or no change in the ERP: and that any activity changes present in the EEG after TMS of the control site were driven by the TMS.although phosphenes have been used to study visual awareness, the neural mechanisms generating them have not yet been delineated. we directly tested the two leading hypotheses of how phosphenes arise. these hypotheses correspond to the two competing views of the neural genesis of awareness: the early, feedforward view and the late, recurrent feedback model.",PMC2939984.json,"artificial percepts (phosphenes) can be induced by applying transcranial magnetic stimulation (tms) over human visual cortex. although phosphenes have been used to study visual awareness, the neural mechanisms generating them have not yet been delineated. we directly tested the two leading hypotheses of how phosphenes arise. these hypotheses correspond to the two competing views of the neural genesis of awareness: the early, feedforward view and the late, recurrent feedback model. we combined online tms and eeg recordings to investigate whether the electrophysiological correlates of conscious phosphene perception are detectable early after tms onset as an immediate local effect of tms, or only at longer latencies, after interactions of tms induced activity with other visual areas. stimulation was applied at the intensity threshold at which participants saw a phosphene on half of the trials, and brain activity was recorded simultaneously with electroencephalography. phosphene perception was associated with a differential pattern of tms evoked brain potentials that started to ms after stimulation, and encompassed a wide array of posterior areas. this pattern was differentiated from the tms evoked potential after stimulation of a control site. these findings suggest that conscious phosphene perception is not a local phenomenon, but arises only after extensive recurrent processing.",0.6036866359447005,0.3333333333333333,0.3379126947688094

It is important to note that sun exposure does not necessarily correlate with vitamin D levels, and, in fact, when vitamin D intake was measured, it was found not to be associated with lymphoma risk . Furthermore, vitamin D receptor polymorphisms have been shown not to have a statistically significant association with lymphoma risk .Despite claims by the tanning industry, recent evidence supports an association between indoor tanning and increased risk of skin cancers, including BCC, SCC, and melanoma. While association studies have correlated vitamin D levels with protection against various internal malignancies and other disease states, acquiring vitamin D by cutaneous UV exposure is not necessary, and non carcinogenic sources, such as dietary supplementation, are to be preferred.

"The proposed binding sites include a wheat germ agglutinin homologous site on S2 (WGA aa18 23), a neutral glycolipid binding site on S2 (NGL aa37 51), a ganglioside binding site on S3 (GAN aa37 51), and aerolysin homologous sites on S2 (2AH AA52 72, 82) and S3 (3AH AA52 72, 82) .

The preference for 2 3 linked versus 2 6 linked sialic acid is particularly interesting.

" A series of studies provided descriptive evidence, showing that price variability tends to be greater when tax structures deviate from a specific uniform one. As a lower average price along with greater price variability reflects more tax avoidance opportunities, it implies that complicated tax structures may be associated with higher cigarette consumption as a result of less effective taxation policies. Therefore, complicated tax structures may lead to stagnant cigarette consumption through providing opportunities for smokers to avoid paying high taxes and maintain their consumption level .Therefore, we used different specifications to model the association between tax structures and cigarette consumption. First, we employed a reduced form approach by regressing cigarette consumption on tax structure measures and sociodemographic characteristics without controlling for average taxes. Consumption data were obtained from surveys conducted by the International Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation Project (the ITC project).A change from a specific to an ad valorem structure was associated with a 3.8% (p0.05) higher cigarette consumption in HICs. In addition, a change from a uniform to a tiered structure was associated with a 43.7% (p0.05) higher cigarette consumption in LMICs.

In this study, we have examined HIV 1 envelope evolution in serial samples from a subtype C infected patient with prior evidence of CCR5 to CXCR4 coreceptor switching to determine if these same barriers were similar or even higher in subtype C HIV 1.To investigate the genotypic changes associated with the observed phenotype changes we first focused on the V3 region, since previous studies have established this region as a major determinant of coreceptor usage. Sample clustering within a phylogenetic tree indicated the env clones were representative of HIV 1 subtype C isolates with various coreceptor usage and donor age, and were more closely linked to each other than to any other patient isolate, excluding dual infection or sample contamination (data not shown) . All sequences were checked for intra patient recombination by inferring separate phylogenetic trees for the V1/V2, C2, V3, C3 and V4 region.This was determined through single round infection of an NP2.CD4 cell line expressing one of the following alternative coreceptors: CCR3, CCR8, FPRL 1, APJ, CMKLR1, RDC 1, CXCR6, CCR1, GPR1 or CCR6.

This process provides a possible mechanism for the formation of a mineral dense surface layer in a caries lesion and for other pathological decalcification and calcification processes in biological systems .The two HA saturated solutions with different pHs were placed in the two compartments of the diffusion cell. The relatively rapid renewal rate kept the composition of this solution essentially constant while the composition of the solution in the CC continued to change as a result of diffusion of ions between the two solutions .

"This complexity is accounted for in such a way that body sway during quiet stance can be described as an inverted pendulum . To balance this pendulum, torques must be generated from the combined effects of passive muscle and joint properties, feedback mechanisms such as stretch reflexes, and feed forward volitional activation. When postural stability is threatened by destabilizing forces, it has been reported that reflex excitability is enhanced independent of changes in volitional muscle activation .Regulation of Feed forward and Feedback Strategies at the Human Ankle during Balance Control 19965100 Stretch reflex amplitude varied with the level of external support provided by the environment. In each environment, the perturbations elicited a short latency stretch reflex in Sol, MG, LG, and PL without a subsequent long latency response. From these data it is clear that reflex amplitude was significantly attenuated in Sol, MG, LG, and PL during interaction with the most unstable load.We hypothesized that subjects would compensate for reduced postural support by increasing the magnitude of agonist antagonist co contraction and also by increasing stretch reflex excitability. Although the current results are consistent with H reflex modulation during postural stabilization, the relationship between environmental stability, feed forward activation, and reflex excitability appears to differ between the upper and lower limbs. The combination of both the environment and the volitional strategy will then influence the nervous systems reliance on feedback mechanisms for postural support.",PMC2907075.json,"the dynamics of sway during quiet stance have often been approximated by the movement of an unstable inverted pendulum. controlling this unstable load requires the nervous system to balance the reliance on feed forward volitional activation and feedback mechanisms such as stretch reflexes. it has been demonstrated that reflex excitability is heightened when postural stability is threatened by destabilizing forces in the environment. however, the relationship between postural stability, volitional activation, and stretch reflex excitability remains unclear. we addressed this question by characterizing feed forward and feedback activation strategies during balance of a simulated inverted pendulum. we hypothesized that feed forward co contraction and stretch reflex amplitude would scale together as the external support provided by the environment was reduced. electromyographic (emg) responses in muscles of the lower limb were used to characterize co contraction patterns and stretch reflex amplitude as subjects stabilized the simulated loads. our results revealed that co contraction magnitude did indeed scale with increasingly destabilizing torques; however reflex amplitude was attenuated as stability was reduced. these findings suggest that the contribution of feedback mechanisms to postural stability depends on both the level of stability provided by the environment and how the environment influences the pattern of volitional activation.",0.6467889908256881,0.2903225806451613,0.3835510480030214

"The effects of contraction dyssynchrony on global LV mechanical function have been well documented; however, its impact on LV energetic function has received less attention. Here the heart is devoid of external neurohumoral stimuli, loading conditions can be independently controlled, and global LV mechano energetic function can be quantified in terms of the myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2) pressure volume area (PVA) relationship. The primary goal of the present study was to assess the effects of contraction dyssynchrony on global LV mechano energetic function in an isolated rabbit heart preparation.However, compared to RA pacing, the MVO2 PVA relationship intercept significantly increased with dyssynchronous contraction (; RA pacing: 0.025  0.003, RVOT pacing: 0.029  0.003 mL O2/beat/100gLV, P < 0.05) . For our dataset, a significant correlation (R2 = 0.54, P < 0.001; ) existed between excess MVO2 (i.e., MVO2RVOT  MVO2RA) and lost PVA (PVA  PVARVOT). The observed PVA in the setting of contraction dyssynchrony may underestimate the mechanical activity at the cellular level (internal PVA, termed PVA) that determines the measured MVO2.Following RVOT pacing induced contraction dyssynchrony, global LV mechano energetic function was adversely affected. A possible mechanism explaining the observed increase in MVO2 with dyssynchrony is that the observed PVA at the global level underestimates the internal PVA at the cellular level, which is likely to be the true determinant of MVO2.

"Growth factor deficiencies lead to impaired wound healing, as reduced levels of epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF 1), and several other growth factors have been observed in chronic wounds when compared with normal acute wounds.

These SNPs were typed in a large multiple sclerosis dataset consisting of 2,369 trio families, 5,737 cases and 10,296 unrelated controls.in light of this observation it might be expected that some of the variants of established relevance in one autoimmune disease may also be relevant in other related conditions. based on this hypothesis we tested seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) that are known to be associated with type 1 diabetes in a large multiple sclerosis dataset consisting of 2,369 trio families, 5,737 cases and 10,296 unrelated controls. two of these seven snps demonstrated evidence for association with multiple sclerosis; rs12708716 from the clec16a gene (p=1.61016) and rs763361 from the cd226 gene (p=5.4108).In a combined analysis using all available case control and trio family data (23,140 individuals), the strongest evidence for association was identified for rs12708716 from the C type lectin domain family 16, member A (CLEC16A) gene (p=1.61016) followed by rs763361 from the CD226 gene (p=5.4108).

"To test such an idea about Mb, however, requires experimental evidence that Mb can interact with fatty acid and enhances fatty acid solubility . Indeed, 1H NMR measurements of palmitate (PA) titration in MbCN solution reveal a selective change in the 8 heme methyl signal, consistent with a specific interaction in a localized region of Mb. These observations suggest then that Mb may indeed serve as an intracellular fatty acid transporter .In the literature, many studies have used MbCN as a surrogate model for the physiological MbO2, because it shares similar structural features but exhibits observable hyperfine shifted resonances of the heme groups away from the crowded diamagnetic region . Upon addition of PA to MbCN, only the 8 heme methyl signal intensity decreases. In MbCN, the detected PA signal indicates that palmitate has about 40 times greater solubility in Mb than in Tris buffer.The experimental data suggest that Mb can bind to PA and broaden the monolithic view that only fatty acid binding protein (FABP) traffics fatty acid in the cell. The selective change in the 1H NMR signal of the 8 heme methyl of MbCN during palmitate titration and the increased palmitate solubility in the presence of Mb points to a role for Mb in transporting fatty acid and sets the basis for future experiments, which must confirm its role in regulating fatty acid metabolism.

"In this work, we report on the formulation of a metric, termed instrumentation noise equivalent exposure (INEE), which represents the detector entrance exposure at which instrumentation noise and quantum noise become equal, and discuss the experimental results obtained from three different custom designed CCD based detectors with different x ray sensitivities and a commercial x ray image intensifier (XII). A simulation study is presented that demonstrates the effect of detector blur and image post processing blur on INEE measurements. The purpose of the simulation study is to reveal the robustness of this metric against post processing in digital images as well as its dependence on inherent detector blur.Therefore, the measured total noise (Nm) can be represented as (1)Nm2=k1(E+INEE), where E is the x ray entrance exposure to the detector, INEE is the instrumentation noise equivalent exposure (in units of entrance exposure) and k1 is a proportionality constant relating exposure to digital numbers. The INEE can be evaluated experimentally, when the measured SNR2 versus exposure data are fitted to to determine the constant B. In other words, INEE is the detector entrance exposure at which instrumentation noise and quantum noise become equal (i.e., E = B in ) and SNR2 is half the value that would be obtained from quantum statistics alone. For exposures above the INEE, the detector performance would be more quantum limited, and for exposures below the INEE it would be more instrumentation noise limited.This study demonstrates that the INEE is a practical way to gauge the range of quantum limited performance for clinical x ray imaging detectors such that exposure below the INEE will be instrumentation rather than quantum noise limited. The simulation study presented here has shown that smoothing (which is linear and performed on the acquired images as a post processing step) does not change the measured value of the INEE.

"Ultraviolet photodissociation (UVPD) is the newest activation method that has been developed for the analysis of intact proteins []. In order to affect both protein charge state and proton mobility, we employ a highly efficient carbamylation reaction that converts the basic primary amines of Lys side chains and the N terminus to less basic carbamates. The impact of charge state and proton mobility on HCD and UVPD of six proteins and a mixture of ribosomal proteins were investigated.shows the base peak LCMS traces for a mixture of ribosomal proteins prior to and after carbamylation. In general, carbamylation increases the retention times of the ribosomal proteins by an average of 16  7 min, an increase that is modulated by the number of Lys residues per protein (e.g., the hydrophobicity and concomitant change in retention time scales with the number of carbamylated groups). Carbamylation significantly reduced the number of ribosomal proteins and matched fragment ions identified by HCD but had a far more modest impact on the UVPD results.In particular, this work aims to compare the fragmentation of carbamylated and unmodified proteins to evaluate the influence of mobile protons and charge state upon HCD and UVPD. Carbamylation of the primary amines of Lys and the N terminal amine converts them to non basic groups , leaving Arg residues as the most basic sites, followed by His.

"Manipulations of auditory feedback for fundamental frequency (F0), or vocal pitch, have also been used to study sensorimotor control during vocalizations. They found an identical mid utterance compensation response in both conditions. In the present study, we compared the compensation response at utterance onset to that at mid utterance, to determine if these responses were equivalent.We found that the onset trials caused a shift in the initial F0 of the following trials, even when an onset trial was preceded by a control trial, indicating some level of single trial adaptation. Without an examination of the very beginning of a motor command, it is possible that any aftereffects are caused by an early within movement compensation for feedback alterations. Even within the adaptation block, the change in initial F0 was much smaller than the feedback alteration and the final change in F0 (as measured by median F0 during the entire utterance).In this study, we have shown that the compensation response at utterance onset is larger than the compensation response to a perturbation mid utterance.

Transcriptional profiling by RNA seq reveals a major effect on genes expressed in the intestine, including reduced expression of endopeptidases, transmembrane transporters, and components of the peritrophic matrix.background the testicular receptors 2 and 4 (tr2, tr4) comprise a small subfamily of orphan nuclear receptors. genetic studies in mouse models have identified roles for tr4 in developmental progression, fertility, brain development, and metabolism, as well as genetic redundancy with tr2. here we study the adult functions of the single drosophila member of this subfamily, dhr78, with the goal of defining its ancestral functions in the absence of genetic redundancy.We show that DHR78 mutants have a shortened lifespan and reduced motility. Taken together, this data suggests that DHR78 plays a major role in regulating genes in the adult midgut, including enzymes that promote nutrient uptake.

"However, little attention has been paid to the conditioning role of acculturation in determining the impact of social activities on depressive symptoms . Based on the issues raised in the above review, the present study was designed to explore the independent and interactive effects of acculturation and social activity on depressive symptoms using a sample of community dwelling Korean American older adults. We hypothesized that those with lower levels of acculturation would gain more benefits from social activities compared with their counterparts .The sample consisted of 675 Korean American older adults.

"For undersampled k space data on a Cartesian grid, the sensitivity encoding (SENSE) algorithm can be applied to each spectral point in image domain after performing the Fourier transform to obtain the unaliazed MRSI spectra. With k space data on a Cartesian grid, MRSI reconstruction can also be achieved in the k space domain using the simultaneous acquisition of spatial harmonics (SMASH) or generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisitions (GRAPPA) algorithms. To further speed up MRSI with non Cartesian k space sampling such as spiral k space trajectories, parallel imaging reconstruction with arbitrary location k space data can be applied ().A phantom study was performed using a standard GE spherical MRS phantom. The in vivo study was conducted on a healthy young male subject. Similar to the phantom study, a 2D single slice was localized with a PRESS module.Parallel spectroscopic imaging reconstruction with arbitrary trajectories using k space sparse matrices is implemented and tested on MRSI with spiral k space trajectories in both phantom and in vivo studies.

"Community based participatory research (CBPR), which is a partnership approach to research that equitably involves, for example, community members, organizational representatives, and researchers in all aspects of the research process and in which all partners contribute expertise and share decision making and ownership , is quickly becoming a common approach in a variety of settings. From 2006 to 2008, our research team conducted three focus group studies with a total of 72 groups and 519 participants. During this time we developed a method of conducting and analyzing focus groups that included community members in all stages of research.Our human subjects committee would not allow different training for community members; therefore, we paired a community member with a researcher who went through all of the training with the community member, explaining more as they continued. Although this approach took significant time (in some cases several days as opposed to a few hours), we believe it was appropriate because our community partners learned more about the research process, had a better understanding of human subjects concerns and legality, and emerged more self confident and satisfied than if they had tried to get through the training themselves. Our community partners appreciated this approach and said that not only did they gain a better understanding of research and human subjects protections, but also got a chance to get to know and learn more about the different individuals on the research team who helped them through the training.Overall, we believe our methodology has resulted in a successful method for conducting focus groups in CBPR studies. Our strategies for involving community members in all phases of the research process can be used by other CBPR teams, particularly those teams working with underserved or traditionally marginalized communities.

"The resulting tool compounds are then used in appropriate animal models, for example in models of the cognitive deficits in schizophrenia or manic depressive psychoses. Similarly, observations of preferential effects in some domains of cognition over others might prompt a revised selection of test paradigms in the animal model proof of concept studies, which in turn might influence subsequent more specific studies of specific cognitive tests in healthy volunteers and/or small studies of relevant patients. Thus, extremely valuable information could be derived from experimental paradigms based on comparable measures in both preclinical animal models and in early small scale clinical tests.Developing Translational Animal Models for Symptoms of Schizophrenia or Bipolar Mania 18790726 The preceding example of cross species development of psychiatric test paradigms illustrated transitions from human to animal and back to human tests.

"An alternative to the research designs just discussed, both of which rely heavily on census geography to define analytic units, is to use survey data to examine individual level racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in residential proximity to hazardous sites. In this study, in which we used survey data from a representative probability sample of the American population linked with national data from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), we conducted the first national level analysis, to our knowledge, of social inequalities in the distribution of polluting industrial facilities employing individual level survey data. Our goals were to demonstrate the advantages of using survey data over traditional census data approaches in conducting environmental inequality analyses and, by contributing to the growing body of evidence pertaining to disparities in environmental exposures, to lay a foundation for future analyses of the role environmental factors play in racial and socioeconomic disparities in health and mortality .Racial and Socioeconomic Disparities in Residential Proximity to Polluting Industrial Facilities: Evidence From the Americans Changing Lives Study 19890171 This study involved several limitations worth noting.

However, the same general picture was manifest, i.e. co labeling of CCAP and bursicon gold particles in many of the same vesicles . It rather indicates that other peptide species besides CCAP and bursicon are likely expressed by these same neurons and independently packaged to enable release specificity (but see also ) .",PMC2637405.json,"numerous neurosecretory cells are known to secrete more than one peptide, in both vertebrates and invertebrates. these co expressed neuropeptides often originate from differential cleavage of a single large precursor, and are then usually sorted in the regulated pathway into different secretory vesicle classes to allow separable release dynamics. here, we use immuno gold electron microscopy to show that two very different neuropeptides (the nonapeptide crustacean cardioactive peptide (ccap) and the kda heterodimeric bursicon) are co packaged within the same dense core vesicles in neurosecretory neurons in the abdominal ganglia of periplaneta americana. we suggest that this co packaging serves a physiological function in which ccap accelerates the distribution of bursicon to the epidermis after ecdysis to regulate sclerotization of the newly formed cuticle.",0.40318302387267907,0.16533333333333333,0.26547999498759584
"The time of a cancer diagnosis has been identified as a teachable moment when a high proportion of cancer survivors are hungry for nutrition information. In 2003, the American Cancer Society (ACS) assembled a group of experts on nutrition, exercise, and cancer survivorship, with the goal of reviewing the extant literature to develop guidelines for lifestyle changes to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence and also to improve the overall health of cancer survivors. This advisory panel subsequently published an initial report entitled, Nutrition and Physical Activity During and After Cancer Treatment: An American Cancer Society Guide to Informed Choices. Three years later, these guidelines were reviewed again and a subsequent report was published in 2006.In the ACS guide, seven studies are reviewed which report associations between overweight or obesity and increased risk of cancer recurrence or mortality. Most importantly, oncology nurses should educate their patients that being overweight may increase the risks of cancer recurrence and cancer mortality, and is certainly a risk factor for prevalent co morbidities among survivors that contribute to overall mortality. In summary, for overweight and obese cancer survivors, a thoughtful plan for weight reduction will likely reduce prevalent co morbidities within this population and may ultimately impact cancer recurrence and mortality .Cancer survivors currently comprise 3%4% of the US population and their numbers are steadily rising. Although improvements in cure rates are cause for great celebration, cancer survivors are at increased risk for recurrence, as well as several co morbid conditions.

We also explore whether competence is a more robust predictor of outcome among patients with specific clinical features which are believed to require greater skill on the part of therapists .Three studies have examined the association between competence and outcome in CT for depression. Thus, existing studies have yet to test whether ratings of therapist competence predict subsequent symptom change . Other evidence of moderators of the relationship between competence and outcome was limited to the session to session analyses focused on patients early responses to treatment .Our results show that competence ratings predict session to session symptom change early in treatment, when patients improve most rapidly.

"Umbilical cord blood transplantation is a relatively new transplant option with an estimated 15,000 cord blood transplants having been performed to date.

Umbilical cord blood transplants were also associated with almost half the risk of chronic graft vs host disease risk.

However, these studies did not address the possibility that pain may lead to sleep disturbance through its effect on depression  .The Contribution of Pain and Depression to Self Reported Sleep Disturbance in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis Pain Data analyses were conducted using SPSS 19.0. Variables shown significantly associated with associated with sleep disturbance (p < .05) were evaluated using a hierarchical multiple regression approach in which blocks of variables were entered according to the following sequence: (1) the control variables of sociodemographic factors and medication use, (2) disease activity/pain, (3) illness beliefs and pain coping, and (4) depressive symptoms. Finally, a model that examined whether depressive symptoms mediated the effects of pain on sleep disturbance was evaluated .Hierarchical multiple regression findings demonstrated that SF 36 pain and depressive symptoms were the most important predictors of sleep disturbance, each being individually associated with higher PSQI scores. Also, lower internality and higher income were associated with greater sleep disturbance. The cross sectional nature of the findings precluded an understanding of the directionality between pain, depression, and sleep disturbance.",PMC3245817.json,"the objective of this paper is to assess the contribution of disease activity, pain, and psychological factors to self reported sleep disturbance in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra), and to evaluate whether depression mediates the effects of pain on sleep disturbance. the sample included patients with confirmed ra participated in an assessment of their disease activity, pain, psychological functioning, and sleep disturbance during a baseline evaluation prior to participating in a prospective study to help them manage their ra. self measures included the rapid assessment of disease activity in rheumatology (radar), the sf 36 pain scale, the helplessness and internality subscales of the arthritis helplessness index (ahi), the active and passive pain coping scales of the pain management inventory (pmi), the center for epidemiological studies depression scale (ces d), and the pittsburgh sleep quality index (psqi). hierarchical multiple regression analysis confirmed that higher income, pain, internality, and depression contributed independently to higher sleep disturbance. a mediational analysis demonstrated that depression acted as a significant mechanism through which pain contributed to sleep disturbance. cross sectional findings indicate that pain and depression play significant roles in self reported sleep disturbance among patients with ra. the data suggest the importance of interventions that target pain and depression to improve sleep in this medical condition.",0.5414847161572052,0.21929824561403508,0.3047609309241235
"Because tissue level strain is a critical regulator of bone growth and remodeling (; ; ), understanding how stiffness is regulated by bone morphology and material properties during development is important for designing biophysical stimuli to promote healthy bone growth and prevent bone loss . The goal of this study was to relate in vivo bone stiffness to whole bone morphology, cross sectional geometry, and tissue composition during development.

"The mechanisms that give rise to patterns of co occurrence of adolescent violent behavior and adolescent drug using behavior remain uncertain. Clearly, intoxication secondary to drug use can provoke and predict bouts of violent behavior that is not premeditated . In this respect, we are motivated to develop a generalized latent class type model in order to discover the joint behavioral patterns of violent behavior and the simultaneous use of multiple drug compounds, including alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis as the most frequently occurring examples.Therefore, we concluded that the JLCA is locally identifiable with decent goodness of fit when there were three joint classes identified by three class variables (i.e., violent behavior with four classes, alcohol drinking with three classes, tobacco cigarette smoking with three classes, and other drug use with three classes). presents the representative joint patterns for the behavioral classes elicited by JLCA. We propose a new model for multiple latent classes, calling it by the name of joint latent class analysis (JLCA) because it seeks to explain the joint patterns of two or more latent class variables.This paper proposes a new latent variable model that can be used to examine underlying joint patterns of multiple latent class variables, whereas the traditional LCA only identifies a small number of classes of a single discrete latent variable.

"Analyses of heroin market trends may facilitate an understanding of these changes. We examined DEA DMP data on price and purity for all four sources of heroin coming into the US from 19932004 for up to 20 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs). While heroin market trends are reported by governmental agencies, this report represents an independent analysis of US heroin price and purity trends and the effects of Colombian sourced heroin on the US heroin market .Another potential source of bias in this study is that the percentage of heroin of unknown origin decreased over the study period. Historically, heroin samples that were not analyzable, i.e., of unknown origin, were of very low quality, or bunk. The discovery of high quality samples led to the development of the South American signature. Thus, while some degree of misclassification is likely present, the most plausible explanation for the relationship between price and the percent of heroin originating from South American is the role of this new market participant and not just a monitoring effect .The findings presented in this paper argue that, in addition, a new source of heroin has contributed to historic heroin trends in the US market . The rise of purity and decline in price of US retail heroin during the 1990s appears directly related to Colombian sourced heroin effectively competing with and collapsing the Asian sourced heroin market in the US.

"Awareness of LTP sensitization is also increasing in Northern and Central Europe.  There, diagnosis of LTP sensitization using plant extracts is difficult due to a frequent co sensitization to birch pollen allergens, especially the major birch pollen allergen Bet v 1, Bet v 1 cross reactive food allergens, and profilins, all heat labile proteins, known as inducers of mild clinical manifestations.

"Furthermore, this effect is quite substantial in tests of item recognition memory, with old items showing 2567% more variability in strength than the new items (for reviews see ; ; ). An alternative account of the old item variance effect is based on dual process theory (, , ), which argues that studied items are associated with more variable memory strengths than new items because both recollection and familiarity contribute to the recognition of old items, whereas only familiarity typically contributes to new item recognition. However, if old item variance is due to the relative contribution of recollection and familiarity, old item variance should be directly related to the inclusion of recollection based responses as measured by remember/know judgments , and not encoding variability per se.one account for this old item variance effect is based on single process theory, which proposes that this effect is due to variability in how well items are initially encoded into memory (i.e., the encoding variability account). in contrast, dual process theory argues that old items are more variable because they are influenced by both recollection and familiarity, whereas recognition of new items relies primarily on familiarity. the current study shows that increasing encoding variability did not increase old item variance, and that old item variance is directly related to the contribution of recollection.In contrast, the results revealed that the increased old item variability was directly related to the contribution of recollection and familiarity. In summary, the present results help to clarify why the strength of studied items is more variable than the strength of new items.

"One highly potent and selective inhibitor of PDF has been the naturally occurring antibiotic actinonin, which has been known to interact with the enzyme bound metal ions (via its hydroxamate functional group) . Recently, we became interested in ascertaining the mechanistic and structural functional features of PDFEc from the point of view of designing novel inhibitors of the enzyme. As will be elaborated in the subsequent sections, this study has shed light on the alternative conformational states of the enzyme and the changes in their microenvironments upon binding of actinonin to the enzyme .Should this be the case, the removal of the active site Ni2+ would result in the loss of one of the binding phases (corresponding to PDFEc Ni2+) while leaving the phase associated with PDFEc Zn2+ (since it is considered nearly impossible to remove bound Zn2+). Hence, contrary to our initial hypothesis, this finding unraveled that the two binding modes of actinonin to PDFEc were due to the distinct conformational states of the enzyme, whose distribution was modulated by the presence or absence of the enzyme bound metal cofactor irrespective of its nature (i.e., Ni2+ versus Zn2+) . Based on the nearly constant stoichiometries (n) for the binding of actinonin to PDFEc as a function of temperature, we surmised that the two binding sites are a consequence of distinct and independent conformational states of PDFEc.With the standard state being equal to 1.0 M, the free energy changes for the binding of actinonin to PDFEc was calculated (G = RT ln Ka) to be 12.2 and 8.6 kcal mol1 for the exothermic and endothermic phases, respectively. At 25 C, the entropic contribution (TS) to the overall free energy of interaction is equal to 8.9 kcal mol1 for the higher affinity exothermic site and 12.4 kcal mol1 for the lower affinity endothermic site. Moreover, consistent with its endothermic binding profile, the magnitude of TS is larger than that of G (12.4 kcal mol1 versus 8.6 kcal mol1, respectively) at the lower affinity binding site.",PMC2644421.json,"we investigated the binding of a naturally occurring antibiotic, actinonin, to the ni2+ reconstituted recombinant form of e. coli peptide deformylase (pdfec) via isothermal titration microcalorimetry. the binding data conformed to both exothermic and endothermic phases with magnitudes of g, h, and ts being equal to 12, 2.7, and 9.3, and 8.7, 3.9, and 12.6 kcal/mol, respectively. evidently, although both phases are dominated by favorable entropic changes, the exothermic phase has about 6.7 kcal/mol enthalpic advantage over the endothermic phase. we observed that the removal of bound ni2+ from pdfec abolished the exothermic phase without affecting the endothermic phase, but it was regained upon addition of zn2+. in conjunction with metal analysis data, we propose that the recombinant form of pdfec is expressed in two stable conformational states that yield markedly distinct itc profiles (i.e., exothermic versus endothermic) upon interaction with actinonin. the existence of two conformational states of pdfec is further supported by the observation of two distinct and independent transitions during the thermal unfolding of the enzyme. in addition, the thermodynamic data reveals that the formation of the pdfec actinonin complex results in the transfer of one h+ from the enzyme phase to the bulk solvent at ph 6.3. both exothermic and endothermic phases produce highly negative cp values, but there is no apparent enthalpy entropy compensation effect upon formation of the pdfec actinonin complex. in view of the known structural features of the enzyme, arguments are presented that the alternative conformational states of pdfec are modulated by the metal ligation at the enzyme site.",0.514003294892916,0.18512396694214875,0.27360382299762875

"A central bar is presented briefly in counterphase with two flanking bars. Similarly, accounts of lateral masking in cycling displays like that illustrated in have ranged from local lateral inhibition accounts to higher level accounts. If the central bar and flankers are not represented as a common object, then the information sampled from the central bar will not be used to update the representation of the flankers, and the central bar will therefore become visible as a separate and distinct object in the display and no motion will be perceived.a central bar repeatedly presented in alternation with two flanking bars can lead to the disappearance of the central bar. recently it has been suggested that this masking effect could be explained by object mediated updating: the information from the central bar is integrated into the representation of the flankers, leading not only to the disappearance of the central bar as a separate object, but also to the perception of the flankers in apparent motion between their real position and the position of the central bar. this account suggests that the visibility of the central bar should depend on the same factors as those that influence the construction and maintenance of object representations.As the separation between the central bar and the flankers as well as the ISI increased, the more visible the central bar became. In particular, as could be seen in experiment 1, the larger the separation between central bar and flankers became, the longer the ISI needed to be in order to produce low visibility of the central bar.

For this re analysis, baseline FPG levels were used to stratify subjects as being normoglycemic (FPG<5.6 mmol/L) or having prediabetes (FPG5.6 6.9 mmol/L) according to previous procedures . Low and high fasting plasma glucose (FPG) is <5.6 and 5.6 6.9 mmol/L.background/objectives: the interaction between fasting plasma glucose (fpg) and fasting insulin (fi) concentrations and diets with different carbohydrate content were studied as prognostic markers of weight loss as recent studies up to six month of duration have suggested the importance of these biomarkers. subjects/methods: this was a retrospective analysis of a clinical trial where participants with obesity were randomized to an ad libitum low carbohydrate diet or a low fat diet with low energy content (1200 1800 kcal/d [5.0 7.5 mj/d]; 30% calories from fat) for 24 months. conclusions: fasting plasma glucose and insulin are strong predictors of the weight loss response to diets with different macronutrient composition and might be a useful approach for personalized weight management.",PMC6584064.json,"background/objectives: the interaction between fasting plasma glucose (fpg) and fasting insulin (fi) concentrations and diets with different carbohydrate content were studied as prognostic markers of weight loss as recent studies up to six month of duration have suggested the importance of these biomarkers. subjects/methods: this was a retrospective analysis of a clinical trial where participants with obesity were randomized to an ad libitum low carbohydrate diet or a low fat diet with low energy content (1200 1800 kcal/d [5.0 7.5 mj/d]; 30% calories from fat) for months. participants were categorized (pretreatment) as normoglycemic (fpg<5.6 mmol/l) or prediabetic (fpg5.6 6.9 mmol/l) and further stratified by median fi. linear mixed models were used to examine outcomes by fpg and fi values. results: after years, participants with prediabetes and high fi lost 7.2 (95%ci 2.1;12.2, p=0.005) kg more with the low fat than low carbohydrate diet, whereas those with prediabetes and low fi tended to lose 6.2 (95%ci 0.9;13.3, p=0.088) kg more on the low carbohydrate diet than low fat diet [mean difference: 13.3 kg (95%ci 4.6;22.0, p=0.003)]. no differences between diets were found among participants with normoglycemia and either high or low fi (both p0.16). conclusions: fasting plasma glucose and insulin are strong predictors of the weight loss response to diets with different macronutrient composition and might be a useful approach for personalized weight management.",0.6304347826086957,0.5236363636363636,0.5100817478816332

" In previous studies we synchronized video kinematic recordings with multi channel EMG during treadmill locomotion to characterize muscle activity during the natural step cycle in rats and mice.  In the current studies, these methods were used to characterize the motor phenotype of tottering mutant mice. Our primary goal was to delineate the qualitative features associated with ataxia at baseline and attacks of paroxysmal dystonia in tottering mutant mice .Six female tottering mutant mice (B6.D2 Cacna1atg/J) were examined between 36 months of age. Synchronized recordings of multi channel EMG with video kinematics were made 214 days following surgical implantation of EMG electrode arrays, as mice walked on a motorized treadmill, as previously described.

"For example, an animal might obtain cues fromtheir father that the environment is safe, while personal experience suggests otherwise.Recent theory identifies the conditions that favour the evolution of reliance on somesources of cues over others, and highlights the importance of cuereliability during cue integration. Evidence that different sources of cues (e.g. genetic and environmental) triggersimilar adaptive phenotypic responsesprovides support for information integration theory, but a key assumption of several cueintegration models concerns the way that organisms respond to cues from differentsources that are in agreement with each other.

"In our manuscript, we confirm significant PDL1 overexpression in the clinical glioma samples, in the established and PDGx glioma cell lines, and in the CSF samples from tumor bearing mice.

"Here we report on a strategy to achieve temporal control over nanoparticle release from biomaterials using cell secreted proteases. This cell triggered release approach utilizes peptides that are degraded by matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) at different rates to immobilize nanoparticles directly to the biomaterial surface. In this report, we developed a strategy to immobilize nanoparticles through peptide tethers and allow for their release and internalization through a cell triggered approach.A single triplicate was left untouched (100% control) and would later be used to normalize the release data. Release data was all normalized to the 100% control within each individual bead type and then evaluated with respect to the release of particles incubated in PBS (i.e. background release) . Plate to plate rheometry was used to determine the mechanical properties of the porous hydrogels.By immobilizing nanoparticles through protease sensitive peptide tethers, release could be tailored specifically for an intended cellular target, which over expresses such proteases. We observed that the protease (namely MMP) expression profile of the seeded cells was the main factor in determining the release and internalization kinetics of MMP sensitive peptide modified particles. Similar trends were observed in 3D micro porous PEG hydrogels indicating protease sensitive tethers are effective in controlling release rate and internalization, with direct applications to the controlled release of DNA and siRNA polyplexes and other nanoparticles in 3 dimensional hydrogels in vivo .",PMC2945696.json,"strategies to control the release rate of bioactive signals from tissue engineering scaffolds are essential for tissue regeneration and tissue engineering applications. here we report on a strategy to achieve temporal control over nanoparticle release from biomaterials using cell secreted proteases. this cell triggered release approach utilizes peptides that are degraded by matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) at different rates to immobilize nanoparticles directly to the biomaterial surface. thus, the peptide immobilized nanoparticles are released with temporal control through the action of cell released mmps. we found that release rates of peptide immobilized nanoparticles were a function of peptide sensitivity to proteases, the number of tethers between the nanoparticle and the surface and the concentration of proteases used to induce release. cellular internalization of the peptide immobilized nanoparticles was also a function of the peptide sensitivity to proteases, the number of tethers between the nanoparticle and the surface and mmp expression profile of the cells. similar trends were observed for peptide immobilized nanoparticles inside micro porous hydrogels, indicating protease sensitive tethers are effective in controlling release rate and internalization of nanoparticles. such a temporal delivery strategy of nanoparticles loaded with therapeutic payloads (e.g. protein, dna, sirna) can be an ideal means to guide tissue formation.",0.6420323325635103,0.3248259860788863,0.4946387765185948
"Neurons in primary visual cortex (area V1) receive input from the thalamus and from an extensive network of lateral connections. An implicit assumption in this debate has been that the relative weight of feedforward and lateral connectivity signals is fixed and is independent of the stimulus. These findings indicate that the relative weight of feedforward and lateral inputs is not fixed, but is contrast dependent.None To further test the causal relationship between spikes and LFP waves, we asked whether the LFP signal at one site could be predicted from spiking at remote locations. Superposition of these waves on the basis of the actual spike times at these sites yielded a simple linear prediction of the LFP trace. Specifically, the synaptic input to neurons during spontaneous activity can be thought of as the superposition of a myriad of traveling waves originating from individual spikes distributed over an extended region of cortex .The progressive disappearance of the traveling waves as the contrast was increased indicates that the relative balance between feedforward and lateral signals is not a fixed quantity, as has been previously assumed. Both the magnitude and the spatial extent of lateral interactions in visual cortex increased markedly as stimulus contrast was reduced, being maximal at zero contrast. Our findings demonstrate that the relative weight of feedforward and lateral inputs is determined, at least in part, by the strength of the visual stimulus.",PMC2610236.json,"neurons in visual cortex are linked by an extensive network of lateral connections. to study the effect of these connections on neural responses, we recorded spikes and local field potentials (lfps) from multi electrode arrays that were implanted in monkey and cat primary visual cortex. spikes at each location generated outward traveling lfp waves. when the visual stimulus was absent or had low contrast, these lfp waves had large amplitudes and traveled over long distances. their effect was strong: lfp traces at any site could be predicted by the superposition of waves that were evoked by spiking in a 1.5 mm radius. as stimulus contrast increased, both the magnitude and the distance traveled by the waves progressively decreased. we conclude that the relative weight of feedforward and lateral inputs in visual cortex is not fixed, but rather depends on stimulus contrast. lateral connections dominate at low contrast, when spatial integration of signals is perhaps most beneficial.",0.5076923076923076,0.21649484536082475,0.3279209229615533
"Computer tailored interventions have become an increasingly common strategy for altering health risk behaviors such as tobacco use, poor diet, and lack of exercise that are linked to chronic disease.

"We have previously conducted fear conditioning experiments using a paradigm in which rats are given an auditory CS paired with a unilateral shock US delivered to one eyelid (, ; ,; ; ). During these experiments, we have observed that in addition to CS evoked freezing behavior, well trained rats also tend to exhibit another distinctive response to the CS: turning in circles away from the eyelid where shock is anticipated. We report that, like freezing, CS evoked turning behavior is a Pavlovian response which depends upon lateralized circuits in the amygdala and PAG that mediate acquisition and expression of conditioned fear (; ; ; Maren, 1998; ).In the present study, we observed that two different conditioned fear responsesfreezing and turningwere both similarly dependent upon the amygdala ( and ), especially the hemisphere contralateral from the US (see below). Hence, amygdala inactivation may have impaired CS evoked turning responses in two different ways: by blocking recall of the CS US association, and by also attenuating the aversiveness of the shocks upon which turning behavior depended (see ). It will also be important for future studies to examine whether induction of CS evoked turning by the US can occur in contexts other than the one where the CS US association was learned, and whether arousing stimuli other than eyelid shocks can induce CS evoked turning behavior in fear conditioned rats .These results indicate that much like conditioned freezing responses, conditioned turning responses also appear to depend preferentially upon the amygdala contralateral from the trained eyelid in our fear conditioning task . These results agree well with prior studies showing that when an auditory CS has been paired with an eyelid shock US, the CS elicits conditioned freezing responses when it is later presented alone without the US (; ; ,). Instead of freezing more to the CS than the CX, rats in the PAIR group froze more to the CX than the CS during training trials (, unshaded regions).",PMC2966824.json,"rats were trained to fear an auditory conditioned stimulus (cs) by pairing it with a mild electric shock (the unconditioned stimulus, or us) delivered to one eyelid. after training, the cs elicited two different conditioned fear responses from rats: a passive freezing response, and an active turning response. the balance between these two modes of conditioned responding depended upon the rat's recent history of encounters with the us. if rats had not recently encountered the us, then they responded to the cs by freezing. but after recently encountering the us, rats exhibited cs evoked turning responses that were always directed away from the trained eyelid, even if the us had recently been delivered to the opposite (untrained) eyelid. this post encounter turning behavior was not observed in rats that had been trained with unpaired presentations of the cs and us, indicating that even though cs evoked turning was selectively expressed after recent encounters with the us, it was nonetheless a conditioned pavlovian fear response that depended upon a learned association between the cs and us. further supporting this conclusion, pharmacological inactivation experiments showed that expression of both freezing and turning behaviors depended upon lateralized circuits in the amygdala and periaqueductal gray (pag) that are known to support expression of pavlovian fear responses. these findings indicate that even though the ability of a cs to elicit pavlovian fear responses depend upon the long term history of cs us pairings, the mode of conditioned responding (freezing versus turning in the present experiments) can be modulated by short term factors, such as the recent history of us encounters. we discuss neural mechanisms that might mediate such short term transitions between different modes of defensive responding, and consider how dysregulation of such mechanisms might contribute to clinical anxiety disorders.",0.5493421052631579,0.1782178217821782,0.2941313185686334

"A barrier to identification of agents to treat methamphetamine physical dependence is the lack of a sensitive withdrawal measure in mammals.

"It has been proposed that the healthspan extension effects of caloric restriction (CR) are at least partially mediated through increased mitochondrial biogenesis . While some evidence suggests that mitochondrial biogenesis and synthesis of mitochondrial proteins is maintained or increased during caloric restriction , very recently others have questioned whether CR increases mitochondrial biogenesis  . We hypothesized that mitochondrial protein synthesis would decrease both because of age and CR.Differences between treatment (AL and CR) and age (young, middle, old) were compared using a two way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The newly synthesized fraction (f) of muscle proteins was calculated from the true precursor enrichment (p) using mass isotopomer distribution analysis [MIDA ]. Protein synthesis was calculated as the change in enrichment of deuterium labeled alanine bound in muscle proteins over the entire labeling period and expressed as the common unit for protein synthesis rates (%*hr1) .These findings lead us to believe that other post transcriptional mechanisms are maintaining mitochondrial protein synthesis during CR .

"Less is known, however, about the time course of speechgesture integration in the real time processing of multimodal discourse . This issue was addressed in this study by recording EEG as healthy adults viewed short video segments of spontaneous discourse with iconic gestures. Event related potentials (ERPs) were computed time locked to the onset of all content words throughout the audio stream and to picture probes .electroencephalogram was recorded as healthy adults viewed short videos of spontaneous discourse in which a speaker used depictive gestures to complement information expressed through speech. event related potentials were computed time locked to content words in the speech stream and to subsequent related and unrelated picture probes. effects were observed 200550ms after speech onset, a time interval associated with semantic processing.When gesture information was available, content words elicited less negative ERPs relative to when gestures were absent. As the speakers iconic gestures presumably provided contextually relevant information, it is likely that words accompanied by gestures were comprehended and integrated more readily than words presented with static frames . Moreover, the magnitude of this sensitivity was inversely correlated with the effect size of gestures on early content words, suggesting that, depending on the individual, gestures can affect either local speechgesture integration or higher order image based aspects of downstream comprehension .",PMC2929818.json,"electroencephalogram was recorded as healthy adults viewed short videos of spontaneous discourse in which a speaker used depictive gestures to complement information expressed through speech. event related potentials were computed time locked to content words in the speech stream and to subsequent related and unrelated picture probes. gestures modulated event related potentials to content words co timed with the first gesture in a discourse segment, relative to the same words presented with static freeze frames of the speaker. effects were observed 200550ms after speech onset, a time interval associated with semantic processing. gestures also increased sensitivity to picture probe relatedness. effects of gestures on picture probe and spoken word analysis were inversely correlated, suggesting that gestures differentially impact verbal and image based processes.",0.6350148367952522,0.45373134328358206,0.5006208134764594
"A conventional UV vis NIR spectrometer can be used to easily record the extinction spectra of nanostructures. Based on this principle, we could convert the PA signal from a sample of the nanostructures into the a by benchmarking against a linear calibration curve based on an organic dye (e.g., methylene blue) that describes the relationship between the PA signal and the a. Then we could acquire a by dividing a by the concentration of the nanostructure.Four types of nanostructures were evaluated in this study: Au Ag nanocages with two different sizes, Au nanorods, and Au nanospheres. The Au nanorods (44.019.8 nm2 in length  width) were synthesized using the method developed by El Sayed and co workers. An organic dye, methylene blue (MB), was used as a reference for calibration because its molar absorption coefficient is well documented.We came up with a suitable way to acquire a,nano by using a calibration curve derived from the linear relationship between the PA signal and a for MB solutions at various concentrations. From , it is apparent that the ratios of absorption to extinction cross sections (a/e) obtained from experimental and theoretical approaches agreed well.

"Despite the profound health costs of cigarette smoking in serious mental illness patients, and evidence that cessation treatment works in this population , mental health providers consistently report that they infrequently (<20%) provide smoking cessation treatments to patients with serious mental illness in Community Mental Health Centers (CMHCs) . Contrary to the common perception among health providers , patients with serious mental illness are frequently willing and able to quit smoking with appropriate support . We evaluated two quality improvement strategies, decision support and academic detailing with data driven feedback, in four CMHC clinics.We implemented two low burden strategies, decision support and academic detailing with feedback, in four CMHC clinics, and found an increase in patient receipt of evidence based cessation pharmacotherapy. In summary, these results suggest that two relatively low burden strategies, decision support and academic detailing with feedback, hold great potential for increasing the provision of smoking cessation treatment to patients with serious mental illness, and increasing their likelihood of quitting as well. Given the consistent high smoking prevalence in the population with serious mental illness in existing evidence , future research should explore the effects of such strategies to decrease the prevalence of smoking and its profound health consequences .CMHC patients have high smoking prevalence.

"Understanding the factors that influence risky driving among young drivers has been the focus of traffic safety researchers for decades. These statistics demonstrate that young drivers are at elevated risk for fatal crashes compared to others. In the present study, we examine how five personality predispositions predict several types of risky driving behaviors and consequences of risky driving among college students: driving violations, driving errors, driving lapses, cell phone driving, traffic citations, and traffic collisions .Although there seems to be a lack of relationships with certain outcomes, these two studies suggest that a lack of Perseverance would be associated with at least more self reported driving violations, driving errors, and driving lapses . Overall, it appears that individuals who are low in Premeditation are more likely to engage in risky driving, but there is some inconsistency with which Premeditation is related to some driving outcomes like aggressive driving . Based on the studies reviewed above, we were able to make the bivariate prediction that Premeditation would be correlated with less driving violations, driving errors, and driving lapses, but were unable to make specific hypotheses regarding cell phone driving, traffic violations, and traffic crashes.In the present study, we predict that Sensation Seeking would be positively related to driving violations, driving errors, and driving lapses . In a bivariate sense, Positive Urgency and Negative Urgency were positively correlated with most driving outcomes including driving errors, driving lapses, driving violations, and cell phone driving.

"Numerous studies indicate that the late positive potential (LPP) reliably indexes the degree of emotional arousal and processing intensity (; ; ). It is thus reasonable to expect that the strength of functional interactions between hub regions such as the amygdala and mPFC and other brain areas should be modulated by the relative intensity of emotional processing. For hemodynamic data, amygdala and mPFC seeded functional connectivity were assessed using the beta series correlation method , which has previously been employed in studies of emotional processing .LPP amplitude to affective scenes has been used to index the intensity of emotional engagement . The mPFC seeded appetitive network and the amygdala seeded appetitive and aversive networks were computed using single trial LPP amplitude estimates, to identify the relation between the level of LPP amplitude estimates and seed based functional connectivity in the brain. Thus, our findings support the hypothesis that the strength of functional interactions between hub regions such as amygdala and mPFC and other brain areas is positively associated with the intensity of emotional processing.We applied the beta series correlation method to assess functional interactions between the seed region and other brain regions . During aversive processing, connections were stronger and more widespread between the bilateral amygdala and visual cortex.

"Here, we examine how mechanical signals affect the phenotype of engineered human microvessels in microfluidic type I collagen gels. The purpose of our study was to determine how chronic exposure to various mechanical factors affected the barrier function and stability of engineered microvessels. Using these configurations, we determined the mechanical signals that were the dominant regulators of barrier function and stability.These data suggest that positive strain (i.e., a positive transmural pressure) is required to obtain morphologically stable vessels, irrespective of the level of shear stress. Effect of Mechanical Factors on the Function of Engineered Human Blood Microvessels in Microfluidic Collagen Gels Cylindrical microvessels were perfused under different flow conditions until day 14 post seeding or until the microvessels became unstable. As flow and its associated factors increased, the permeability coefficients to BSA (PBSA) and 10 kDa dextran (Pdex) decreased, the number of focal leaks decreased to zero, and the size selectivity of the barrierdefined as Pdex/PBSAincreased (p < 0.0001 for all trends; ).This work reports the effect of the mechanical microenvironment on the barrier properties and stability of engineered microvessels in microfluidic collagen gels. We found that increased flow led to stronger barrier function and greater stability via increases in shear stress and radial strain (or transmural pressure), respectively.

" These changes in risk factors are also reflected in the increasing rates of cardiovascular disease in these same populations. In contrast to the measurement of classical cardiovascular risk factors, few studies have examined these risk factors in elderly African Americans and none in the elderly populations of developing countries.

Regardless, homocysteine levels were higher in the men from Ibadan.

"The most conspicuous and extensively studied behavior of anuran amphibians (frogs and toads) is their acoustic communication. In these species the tie between vocal communication and reproduction is unambiguous . Thus, studying the hormonal bases of acoustic communication in frogs presents a useful model for investigations of the action of these systems on vertebrate sensory physiology and behavior .There are two hormonal systems that are widely recognized to influence reproductive behaviors, including acoustic communication, in anurans. Altogether, these electrophysiological studies, along with others showing seasonal fluctuations in neural activity in the auditory midbrain of both sexes of fire bellied toads (Bombina bombina), grass frogs (Rana temporaria) and the gray tree frog (Hyla chrysoscleis) provide intriguing evidence of the complex influence of sex hormones on sensitivity and spectral filtering of the anuran auditory system . In frogs, there is substantial evidence that AVT administration impacts production of advertisement and territorial calls by males (; ; ; ), and some indication that it enhances sexual receptivity in females .Hormones play a vital role in regulating the sexual behavior of vertebrates, from frogs to humans, and hormonal systems are highly conserved across vertebrate taxa. Acoustic communication is the primary mediator of sexual behavior in the majority of anuran species, thus it provides an excellent system within which to explore the diversity of ways in which hormones work to ensure appropriate and successful reproductive activity. Although the majority of research in anurans has focused on hormonal influences on vocal signal production, intriguing evidence is emerging for a potent role of hormones in regulating signal reception and processing.",PMC2722832.json,"the majority of anuran amphibians (frogs and toads) use acoustic communication to mediate sexual behavior and reproduction. generally, females find and select their mates using acoustic cues provided by males in the form of conspicuous advertisement calls. in these species, vocal signal production and reception are intimately tied to successful reproduction. research with anurans has demonstrated that acoustic communication is modulated by reproductive hormones, including gonadal steroids and peptide neuromodulators. most of these studies have focused on the ways in which hormonal systems influence vocal signal production; however, here we will concentrate on a growing body of literature that examines hormonal modulation of call reception. this literature suggests that reproductive hormones contribute to the coordination of reproductive behaviors between signaler and receiver by modulating sensitivity and spectral filtering of the anuran auditory system. it has become evident that the hormonal systems that influence reproductive behaviors are highly conserved among vertebrate taxa, thus studying the endocrine and neuromodulatory bases of acoustic communication in frogs and toads can lead to insights of broader applicability to hormonal modulation of vertebrate sensory physiology and behavior.",0.5799086757990868,0.25229357798165136,0.3264177608039225
"In light of the above evidence, we hypothesize that episodes of myopic and hyperopic defocus are integrated in a nonlinear fashion, as proposed by Flitcroft: Lens wear causes one or several internal emmetropization signals to rise and eventually become saturated during episodes of lens wear and decline slowly between episodes  . Because we do not know the nature of these signals, we cannot measure them directly, but can measure their effects on the rate of ocular elongation and choroidal thickness. (a) We estimated how quickly the hypothesized signals rise during each episode by giving frequent episodes of lens wear of a range of durations, reasoning that the ocular responses will increase with increasing duration up to an asymptote.Because the chicks in this study were kept in darkness for much of the time, we need to discuss whether the darkness vitiates our results. In the case of positive lenses, it is possible to see effects of brief episodes of lens wear when these episodes are separated by periods of normal vision, although the effects are much smaller than those shown here. This thinning might limit the extent of further choroidal thinning to negative lenses, but would be less of a problem for eyes wearing positive lenses, which cause the choroids to expand.Our results are consistent with the existence of emmetropization signals that increase to saturation during episodes of defocus and then decline between episodes. Furthermore, there seem to be separate signals for the ocular elongation and choroidal components of lens compensation, as well as differences between positive and negative lenses, suggestive of separate signals for myopic and hyperopic defocus. The signals regulating the rate of ocular elongation and choroidal thickness with both positive and negative lens wear rise at a similar rate (1 to 4 min required to increase it by 50%), and fall at drastically different rates: The signal for inhibition of ocular elongation by positive lens wear is the most enduring (a 24.4 hr dark interval is required for a 50% decrease), and the signal for acceleration of ocular elongation by negative lens wear is the most transient (only a 0.4 hr dark interval is required for a 50% decrease); the signals controlling choroidal thickness are intermediate .",PMC2761084.json,"purpose chicks eyes rapidly compensate for defocus imposed by spectacle lenses by changing their rate of elongation and their choroidal thickness. we hypothesize that defocus causes internal emmetropization signals to rise and become saturated during episodes of lens wear and to decline between episodes. we measured the time constants of these signals indirectly by measuring the magnitude of lens compensation in refractive error and ocular dimensions as a function of the duration of episodes and the interval between the episodes. methods first, to study how quickly the signals rose, we gave chicks episodes of lens wear of various durations (darkness otherwise) and estimated the duration required to cause a half maximal effect (rise time). second, to study how quickly the signals declined, we gave episodes of lens wear with various dark intervals in between and estimated the interval required to reduce the maximal effect by half (fall time). results the rise times for the rate of ocular elongation and choroidal thickness were approximately min for positive and negative lenses. the fall times had a broad range of time courses: positive lenses caused an enduring inhibition of ocular elongation with a fall time of hr. in contrast, negative lenses caused a transient stimulation of ocular elongation with a fall time of 0.4 hr. conclusions the effects of episodes of defocus rise rapidly with episode duration to an asymptote and decline between episodes with a time course that depends strongly on the sign of defocus and the ocular component. we suspect that the complex etiology of human myopia may reflect these temporal properties.",0.5908372827804107,0.23137876386687797,0.34813506688829104
"High blood pressure affects about one third of adults and contributes to 13.5 million deaths worldwide each year and about half the global risk for stroke and ischemic heart disease.

"Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) strategies to bridge children to heart transplant (HT) have evolved considerably over the past decade. This may lead to longer durations of MCS prior to HT, further impacting costs . The aim of this study was to utilize a novel linkage between the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) and the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) databases to report contemporary cost and length of stay (LOS) data for children bridged to HT with either VAD or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), compared to patients who did not require MCS .All pediatric (<21 years) HT recipients with available hospital charge information in the linked database were included (2002  2016). Costs were adjusted for clinical characteristics and severity of illness at the time of HT using generalized linear mixed effects models with a random hospital intercept.

"Therefore, it is widely agreed that the diagnostic performance of a human observer is, in most cases, the ultimate test of image quality.

That is, the goal of the CHO is to identify the unknown system of the human observer or, in other words, to learn to predict the output of the human observer.The CHO is a numerical observer that serves as a surrogate for human observers in evaluations of image quality. In this context, one considers an image to be of good quality if it permits the numerical observer to perform well in detecting a known signal (e.g., a lesion) . When properly chosen, the internal noise variance 2 can improve the agreement between the CHO and the human observer , .Our main finding is that, while the CHO and CSVM both generalized well to unseen images reconstructed in the same way as those in the training set, the CHO did not generalize well in this experiment to unseen images reconstructed in different ways.

Consequently, the purpose of this study is to estimate the ability of lower dose levels and IR to display hepatic metastases that can be detected by abdominal radiologists in a larger number of patients, and assess the effect of dose on reader confidence and image quality .On the basis of previous results, five dose levels were chosen for inclusion in this study that corresponded to automatic exposure control settings of 80, 100, 120, 160, and 200 QRM.

"Different synapses in the nervous system commonly exhibit different forms of short term synaptic plasticity. We have addressed these issues by studying excitatory synapses formed by auditory nerve (AN) fibers onto bushy cells (BCs) in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN) (called the endbulb of Held) (; ; ). In addition, we surveyed excitatory synapses in the cerebellum and found similarity among converging synapses, suggesting this phenomenon may be widespread in the nervous system .This technique is applicable for both depressing and facilitating synapses. To quantify the difference in plasticity between two synapses (x and y), we calculated the Pythagorean distance between these vectors: |xy|=i(xiyi)2. To assess whether this similarity was significant for two converging synapses, we compared against distances between non converging synapses, using the Kolmogorov Smirnov test for statistical significance.We evaluated whether coordinated plasticity may represent a more general phenomenon by considering excitatory synapses in the cerebellum.

"There is a rapidly growing literature on the effects of prenatal exposure to alcohol, drugs, and cigarette smoking on child development. Similarly, numerous studies have linked maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy to conduct problems and antisocial behaviors Results for the effects of prenatal drug use vary by type of substance , but there is evidence for effects on conduct problems, violence, and substance abuse  . In this report we investigate the influence of prenatal binge drinking, cigarette smoking, and drug use on meeting criteria for psychiatric disorders at ages 1012 and 1315 years among Indigenous adolescents .These data were collected as part of a lagged sequential study currently underway on four American Indian reservations in the Northern Midwest and five Canadian First Nation reserves. An advisory board was appointed by the tribal council at each participating reservation and is responsible for advising on difficult personnel problems, questionnaire development, reading reports for respectful writing, and assuring that published reports protected the identity of the respondents and the culture. Each tribe provided lists of families of enrolled children aged 1012 years who lived on or proximate to (within 50 miles) the reservation or reserve.Co occurring maternal cigarette smoking and binge drinking when pregnant increased the odds of the study adolescent meeting criteria for alcohol abuse/dependence 3.4 times at Wave 4. For this reason we have hypothesized positive relationships between maternal binge drinking, cigarette smoking, and drug use and meeting criteria for five adolescent psychiatric diagnoses (major depressive disorder, substance use disorder, conduct disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) in early (ages 1012 years) and mid adolescence (ages 1315 years) when controlling for the effects of other risk factors such as family per capita income, living in a single mother headed household, and protective factors such as positive parenting.

"In this work, we present preliminary studies to establish a novel electrochemical immunoassay of phosphorylated AChE as a biomarker for biomonitoring and diagnosis of OP exposures.

"Specifically, the IMB model posits that adherence information, or factual information about medication adherence, has a positive effect on both adherence self efficacy and medication adherence, and that self efficacy acts as a mediator of the relationship between information and adherence. The IMB model also posits that motivation (i.e. perceptions of social support and adherence outcome expectations) influence adherence directly and indirectly through increased self efficacy.

"This article is based on the 2009 Pritzker Distinguished Award Lecture I presented to the Biomedical Engineering Society in the opening symposium of their annual meeting that was convened at Pittsburgh, PA in October 2009. Thus, I dedicate this lecture to all of the biomedical engineering students and fellows whom I have trained over the course of my career . So for many years my group has strived to identify the design principles that Nature uses to build living cells, with the long term goal of leveraging this knowledge to develop new biologically inspired materials and devices for Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine .This coupling between structure and biochemistry within the cytoskeleton also provides a mechanism for cells to convert external mechanical signals into changes in intracellular biochemistry and gene expressiona process known as cellular mechanotransduction. Thus, integrins are indeed mechanoreceptors that transmit mechanical forces across the cell surface over a specific molecular pathway, and that facilitate mechanochemical signal conversion inside the cell. One of the novel predictions of the nucleated cellular tensegrity model is that forces applied to integrins at one point on the cell surface can be rapidly channeled across interconnected cytoskeletal elements to multiple locations distributed throughout the entire cell and nucleus.In this lecture, I tried to convey my path from science to engineering, and from fundamental mechanistic research to technology development and translation. I hope that I fully communicated the challenges I have faced as a biologist who believed that mechanics and structure are as important regulators of cell and tissue function as chemicals and genes. I had to seek out collaborators who shared in my vision and had the patience to teach me engineering principles, concepts, approaches, and vocabulary.",PMC2913424.json,"this article is based on a lecture i presented as the recipient of the pritzker distinguished lecturer award at the biomedical engineering society annual meeting in october 2009. here, i review more than thirty years of research from my laboratory, beginning with studies designed to test the theory that cells use tensegrity (tensional integrity) architecture to stabilize their shape and sense mechanical signals, which i believed to be critical for control of cell function and tissue development. although i was trained as a cell biologist, i found that the tools i had at my disposal were insufficient to experimentally test these theories, and thus i ventured into engineering to find critical solutions. this path has been extremely fruitful as it has led to confirmation of the critical role that physical forces play in developmental control, as well as how cells sense and respond to mechanical signals at the molecular level through a process known as cellular mechanotransduction. many of the predictions of the cellular tensegrity model relating to cell mechanical behaviors have been shown to be valid, and this vision of cell structure led to discovery of the central role that transmembrane adhesion receptors, such as integrins, and the cytoskeleton play in mechanosensing and mechanochemical conversion. in addition, these fundamental studies have led to significant unexpected technology fallout, including development of micromagnetic actuators for non invasive control of cellular signaling, microfluidic systems as therapeutic extracorporeal devices for sepsis therapy, and new dna based nanobiotechnology approaches that permit construction of artificial tensegrities that mimic properties of living materials for applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.",0.5537340619307831,0.12797074954296161,0.31261388975875665

Workers assessed the cord for signs of infection (pus, redness, swelling) during in home visits throughout the neonatal period.The overall contribution to neonatal mortality because of the associated risk between local signs of cord infection and death is difficult to define, and likely varies substantially across communities. Entry of pathogens into the bloodstream to cause death of the neonate seems to occur either directly, in the absence of local signs of umbilical cord infection (for example, shortly after cutting the cord when the umbilical vessels are patent, and before local signs of infection have developed), or via invasion into the bloodstream at a later date from infected umbilical tissue.

"Results from the Womens Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS) [; ; ; ] has caused many postmenopausal women to question whether to start or to continue hormone therapy (HT) to decrease the risk of developing dementia and has caused many others to question the role of estrogen in protecting cognitive function from age related decline in general. In conjunction with the positive results of estrogen obtained in randomized clinical trials in younger women , multiple factors have led to the development of the critical period hypothesis in which it is theorized that estrogen exerts protective effects on cognition only when it is initiated closely in time to menopause, before neural systems become increasingly challenged by age related changes and/or neurons become less sensitive or responsive to HT . In the following sections, we present studies of menopausal women and female monkeys that support the concept that estrogen therapies protect both cognitive function and neurobiological processes .Neuroprotective effects of Estrogen Therapy for Cognitive and Neurobiological Profiles of Monkey Models of Menopause 19475542 Estrogen modulates many different aspects of DA function, including release, turnover, uptake, and receptors in OVX rodents [e.g., ; ; ; ; ].

"Dentin, like other calcified collagenous tissues, contains numerous matrix mineral interfaces that are bridged and integrated by NCPs, which commonly have both conserved motifs that mediate matrix assembly and anionic functional groups that interact with the highly charged mineral surfaces. To test this hypothesis, we then designed a small library of synthetic sequence defined polymers presenting a mix of polar and non polar side chains, with the expectation that the polar groups would act like the polyionic polymers in complexing the inorganic ions while the non polar side chains would mimic the phenylalanine (Phe), tyrosine (Tyr), and tryptophan (Trp) residues in NCP sequences that are believed to contribute matrix matrix interactions . In a recent study, dramatic modifications of CaCO3 crystal growth rate and morphology by peptoids highlighted the potential of using these polymers for biomimetic approaches to controlling mineralization and remineralization.in the vicinity of dentin tubules, the newly formed apatite nano crystals are co aligned with the c axis parallel to the tubular periphery and recovery of tissue ultrastructure is accompanied by development of high mechanical strength. the observed effects are highly sequence dependent with alternating polar and non polar groups leading to positive outcomes while diblock sequences have no effect. the observations suggest aromatic groups interact with the collagen while the hydrophilic side chains bind the mineralizing constituents and highlight the potential of synthetic sequence defined biomimetic polymers to serve as ncp mimics in tissue remineralization.Close examination of the regrown peritubular minerals showed that those formed through the PILP process after pretreatment with inhibitory peptoids were composed of lamellae of fine crystalline apatite nano crystals stacked along the tubular periphery with better apparent alignment than those of normal dentin . The findings reported above show that the use of peptoids designed to interact with both the collagen matrix and mineralizing constituents enhances the in vitro assembly of collagen, impacts subsequent scaffold mineralization, and has a dramatic effect on remineralization of dentin lesions.

"Second, a comparison of kcat/Km for isomerization of GAP by wildtype and K12G mutant TIM shows that interactions with the side chain of Lys 12 stabilize the transition state by 7.8 kcal/mol. One explanation for the much larger 7.8 kcal/mol interaction between the cationic side chain of Lys 12 of TIM and the anionic transition state for the isomerization of GAP is that the effectively intramolecular reaction of the side chain at TIM is favored entropically in comparison to the bimolecular reaction of alkylammonium cations as a result of the freezing of translational, rotational and other motions of the tethered side chain. These cations are highly effective at restoring activity to K12G mutant TIM; however, their effect at a standard state of 1 M, on the stability of the transition state for TIM catalyzed isomerization of GAP is smaller than the 7.8 kcal/mol effect determined for the tethered cationic side chain of Lys 12.the larger 3.9 kcal/mol stabilization by ch3ch2ch2ch2nh3+ is due to hydrophobic interactions between the mutant enzyme and the butyl side chain of the cation activator. there is no significant transfer of a proton from alkylammonium cations to gap at the transition state for the k12g mutant tim catalyzed reaction, because activation by a series of rnh3+ shows little or no dependence on the pka of rnh3+. a comparison of kcat/km = 6.6 106 m1 s1 for the wildtype tim catalyzed isomerization of gap and the third order rate constant of 150 m2 s1 for activation by nh4+ of the k12g mutant tim catalyzed isomerization shows that stabilization of the bound transition state by the effectively intramolecular interaction of the cationic side chain of lys 12 at wildtype tim is 6.3 kcal/mol greater than for the corresponding intermolecular interaction of nh4+ at k12g mutant tim.shows the effect of increasing concentrations of CH3CH2NH3+ on the initial velocity of the K12G mutant TIM catalyzed isomerization of GAP at pH 7.5, 25 C and I = 0.10 (NaCl). shows the dependence of (kcat/Km)obsd (determined as the slopes of the linear correlations in ) for the K12G mutant TIM catalyzed isomerization of GAP on the concentration of CH3CH2NH3+ . shows the dependence of (kcat/Km)obsd for the K12G mutant TIM catalyzed isomerization of GAP on the concentration of several primary ammonium cations RNH3+.",PMC2945285.json,"the k12g mutation at yeast triosephosphate isomerase (tim) results in a 5.5 105 fold decrease in kcat/km for isomerization of glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate, and the activity of this mutant can be successfully rescued by nh4+ and primary alkylammonium cations. the transition state for the k12g mutant tim catalyzed reaction is stabilized by 1.5 kcal/mol by interaction with nh4+. the larger 3.9 kcal/mol stabilization by ch3ch2ch2ch2nh3+ is due to hydrophobic interactions between the mutant enzyme and the butyl side chain of the cation activator. there is no significant transfer of a proton from alkylammonium cations to gap at the transition state for the k12g mutant tim catalyzed reaction, because activation by a series of rnh3+ shows little or no dependence on the pka of rnh3+. a comparison of kcat/km = 6.6 m1 s1 for the wildtype tim catalyzed isomerization of gap and the third order rate constant of m2 s1 for activation by nh4+ of the k12g mutant tim catalyzed isomerization shows that stabilization of the bound transition state by the effectively intramolecular interaction of the cationic side chain of lys 12 at wildtype tim is 6.3 kcal/mol greater than for the corresponding intermolecular interaction of nh4+ at k12g mutant tim.",0.6237623762376237,0.5331125827814569,0.6220321841208533

"These studies revealed that even seemingly identical cells could differ in transcriptional and protein profiles, underscoring the importance of high resolution studies . Short lived, temporal modulations of metabolite and ion levels play crucial roles in signal transduction, often involving concerted, sequential modulation of messenger molecules (e.g., neurotransmittor, calcium ion, inositol phosphates, cAMP). Here, we review recent advances in metabolite and ion imaging using fluorescence based sensor proteins.One of the most exciting outcomes of genetically encoded sensors is the possibility to examine correlations between signaling molecules. The availability of genetically encoded cAMP sensors that can be spectrally separated from calcium dye enabled simultaneous measurement of two molecules in a single cell. Since FLIM FRET experiments require specific setups, and acquisition of lifetime images from the whole cell takes longer than fluorescent intensity measurement, the recording of genetically encoded FRET sensors using this technique has not been the common method of choice.At least for a few molecules, biosensors have now improved to the point where they can be used in more demanding experimental settings such as chronic studies of specific cells placed in their native context (e.g., specific nerve cells in brain), and high throuput application. Genetically encoded sensors allow real time measurement of a substrate at subcellular resolution by targeting sensor proteins to the compartment of interest, offering potential to fill the current knowledge gap.

Because of the cross sectional study design, it is difficult to ascertain whether pain severity contributed to social isolation and increased symptomatology or whether social isolation and increased symptomatology contributed to pain severity. Still, because the item measuring social relations contains the word pain, there is concern for endogeneity with this variable.The association of physical, psychological, social, and spiritual domains with pain severity suggests that multidisciplinary interventions are needed to address the complex nature of pain in HF . describes symptom frequencies; of all symptoms evaluated, the most common symptoms were fatigue (n = 63, 75.9%); pain in arms, legs, and joints (n = 67, 71.3%); and shortness of breath (n = 58, 61.7%). The overall model explained 44% of the variance in pain severity (R2 = 0.436; F (8, 87) = 8.38, P < 0.000); lower social well being (greater interference with social relations) and increased number of symptoms were independently associated with pain severity.",PMC2908037.json,"although dyspnea and fatigue are hallmark symptoms of heart failure (hf), the burden of pain may be underrecognized. this study assessed pain in hf and identified contributing factors. as part of a multicenter study, veterans with hf (96% male, 11 years) completed measures of symptoms, pain (brief pain inventory [bpi]), functional status (functional morbidity index), and psychological state (patient health questionnaire 2 and generalized anxiety disorder 2). single items from the bpi interference and the quality of life end of life measured social and spiritual well being. demographic and clinical variables were obtained by chart audit. correlation and linear regression models evaluated physical, emotional, social, and spiritual factors associated with pain. fifty three (55.2%) hf patients reported pain, with a majority (36 [37.5%]) rating their pain as moderate to severe (pain 4/10). the presence of pain was reported more frequently than dyspnea (67 [71.3%] vs. [61.7%]). age (p = 0.02), psychological (depression: p = 0.002; anxiety: p = 0.001), social (p < 0.001), spiritual (p = 0.010), and physical (health status: p = 0.001; symptom frequency: p = 0.000; functional status: p = 0.002) well being were correlated with pain severity. in the resulting model, 38% of the variance in pain severity was explained (p < 0.001); interference with relations (p < 0.001) and symptom number (p = 0.007) contributed to pain severity. the association of physical, psychological, social, and spiritual domains with pain suggests that multidisciplinary interventions are needed to address the complex nature of pain in hf.",0.515748031496063,0.2450592885375494,0.30044474443590985
"A history of sexual assault in the military (SAIM) is unique to women veterans and highly associated with decreased sexual satisfaction. Thus, trauma may mediate decreased sexual satisfaction through its effect on the relational domain of sexual satisfaction . In this study we develop and test a conceptual model to describe the association of SAIM and sexual dissatisfaction through four proposed mediators: (1) lower emotional health related quality of life, (2) lower physical health related quality of life, (3) gynecological problems, and (4) disruption in interpersonal relationships as measured by lack of a close partner.We used logistic regression to separately model the association between each of the four proposed mediators and the exposure (SAIM), adjusting for age. After determining that each of the mediators was independently associated with both SAIM and sexual satisfaction, we used a nested approach to test the proposed mediation model, fitting a sequence of logistic regression models. We first tested an unadjusted odds ratio for decreased sexual satisfaction, given SAIM (model 1).Women veterans are exposed at high rates to sexual trauma, which adversely impacts sexual satisfaction, an important aspect of health related quality of life. Much of the adverse impact of sexual assault in the military on sexual satisfaction in women veterans is explained by decrements in emotional health related quality of life.

Dividing the total volume into the total profile count yielded a density count (profiles per mm3) for each alcohol exposed and each control brain. This provided a quantitative basis for comparing each age matched alcohol/control pair and also for comparing the total mean density counts for all alcohol exposed brains combined with the total mean density counts for all control brains combined.Consistently, the alcohol exposed brains had a high density of AC3 positive profiles in many brain regions, whereas the control brains had no regions where a high density of stained profiles could be found.

"Specifically, individuals with higher baseline oxygenation tend to have a smaller fMRI signal and vice versa, when using identical stimuli. In the present study, we aim to test the utility of TRUST MRI in distinguishing subject groups in a model situation, in which the neural activity differences between two subject groups are known and we ask the question that whether or not fMRI can detect these regional differences with and without the use of TRUST MRI. Alternative normalization parameters, including blood pressure, heart rate, arterial oxygenation, end tidal CO2, and breathing rate, were also assessed.This is important to minimize the confounding effect of visual acuity on the fMRI signals. Vital physiologic signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, arterial oxygenation (MEDRAD, Pittsburgh, PA), and end tidal CO2 (Capnogard, Model 1265, Novametrix Medical Systems, CT), were measured before they entered the magnet room .

"Most importantly, quantum dots possess much better temperature stability than traditional fluorophores. In this study, we have indeed determined that quantum dots largely retain their fluorescence following high temperature treatment, in contrast to traditional fluorophores. This modification of the traditional flow FISH technique should more easily allow the analysis of telomere length in complex immune cell mixtures, particularly in small clinical samples .The method for measuring the telomere length using a flow cytometer has been extensively described in details in the following reports by , and and  . DNA melting, FITC PNA oligonucleotide probe binding and DNA annealing are all highly time and temperature dependent.

By combining telomere length measurement with immunolabeling, we can start with larger numbers of cells more typical for flow FISH protocols, yet still measure telomere length in very small cell subsets. The CD3+CD4+ cell population showed a rate of telomere length decrease of 41.8bp/year, similar to 358bp/year reported by or to 39 to 51 bp/year reported by for nave and memory cells.",PMC2752384.json,"telomere length analysis has been greatly simplified by the quantitative flow cytometry technique flow fish. in this method, a fluorescein labeled synthetic oligonucleotide complementary to the telomere terminal repeat sequence is hybridized to the telomere sequence and the resulting fluorescence measured by flow cytometry. this technique has supplanted the traditional laborious southern blot telomere length measurement techniques in many laboratories, and allows single cell analysis of telomere length in high throughput sample formats. nevertheless, the harsh conditions required for telomere probe annealing (82c) has made it difficult to successfully combine this technique with simultaneous immunolabeling. most traditional organic fluorescent probes (i.e. fluorescein, phycoerythrin, etc.) have limited thermal stability and do not survive the high temperature annealing process, despite efforts to covalently crosslink the antigen antibody fluorophore complex. this loss of probe fluorescence has made it difficult to measure flow fish in complex lymphocyte populations, and has generally forced investigators to use fluorescent activated cell sorting to pre separate their populations, a laborious technique that requires prohibitively large numbers of cells. in this study, we have substituted quantum dots (nanoparticles) for traditional fluorophores in fish flow. quantum dots were demonstrated to possess much greater thermal stability than traditional low molecular weight and phycobiliprotein fluorophores. quantum dot antibody conjugates directed against monocyte and t cell antigens were found to retain most of their fluorescence following the high temperature annealing step, allowing simultaneous fluorescent immunophenotyping and telomere length measurement. since quantum dots have very narrow emission bandwidths, we were able to analyze multiple quantum dot antibody conjugates (qdot 605, and 705) simultaneously with fish flow measurement to assess the age associated decline in telomere length in both human monocytes and t cell subsets. with quantum dot immunolabeling, the mean decrease rate in telomere length for cd4+ cells was calculated at 41.8bp/year, very close to previously reported values using traditional flow fish and southern blotting. this modification to the traditional flow fish technique should therefore allow simultaneous fluorescent immunophenotyping and telomere length measurement, permitting complex cell subset specific analysis in small numbers of cells without the requirement for prior cell sorting.",0.5396290050590219,0.19289340101522842,0.25733131256682795

"A compositional effect is simply the effect that would be expected because the students in a particular school have, on the average, better school adjustment than students in other schools, and the average level of alcohol use in that particular school would therefore be lower than in other schools. It occurs when the general school environment, in this case, school adjustment, has an effect on individual student's use of alcohol above and beyond what would be expected based on his or her own level of school adjustment. While the effect of school adjustment on alcohol use has been well studied at an individual level, little research has assessed the compositional and contextual effects of school adjustment on alcohol use.Traditionally, contextual effects of an individual level variable have been assessed by forming an aggregated mean (e.g., the average level of school bonding of students in a school) and then including this aggregated mean in the level 2 (e.g., school level) model . That is, that the aggregated mean (e.g., the average level of school bonding among students in a school) is the true and correct indicator of the normative or compositional level of school bonding. As a result of this innovation, we were able to use MLCM to decompose the school adjustment variables into their respective within and between school components (i.e., Are there differences between students within schools and are there differences between schools?) We were further able to decompose the between school component into the compositional and contextual effect on alcohol use.The contextual effect represents the expected differences in alcohol use between two students who have the same personal level of school adjustment, but who attend schools differing by one unit in the average level of school adjustment among its students  . After adjusting for pertinent covariates at the student level and school level, each of the three school adjustment scales had a significant negative effect on alcohol use within school.

Given the special situation of case only analysis, we need to introduce a novel permutation strategy in order to make use of the resampling based methods for dealing with multiple testing .genotype data was collected from 1088 individuals from the danish 1905 birth cohort aged over 92/93 years with 12 snps in the foxo1a and 15 snps in the foxo3a genes. our analysis detected a joint effect between rs9486902 in foxo3a and rs2701858 in foxo1a that highly significantly contributes to human longevity (or=3.23, 95% ci: 2.933.53) which is consistent in both males and females. our results were compared with published studies and importance of our novel method and findings discussed.",PMC3714332.json,"genetic interactions or epistasis could make a substantial contribution to variation in human complex traits including longevity. however, detecting epistatic interactions in high dimensional datasets is difficult due to various reasons including multiple testing of correlated tests. we introduce a novel permutation strategy to the case only analysis of gene by gene interaction using multiple snps. the method is applied to genes coding for forkhead box o transcription factors which recently have been associated with human longevity across different populations hypothesizing that epistatic interaction in the regulation and expression of the foxo gene family could contribute to the human longevity phenotype. genotype data was collected from individuals from the danish birth cohort aged over 92/93 years with snps in the foxo1a and snps in the foxo3a genes. our analysis detected a joint effect between rs9486902 in foxo3a and rs2701858 in foxo1a that highly significantly contributes to human longevity (or=3.23, 95% ci: 2.933.53) which is consistent in both males and females. our results were compared with published studies and importance of our novel method and findings discussed.",0.6060606060606061,0.45217391304347826,0.585338919712239
"The increase of membrane cholesterol content induced by the treatment was associated with the appearance of a characteristic muscarinic receptor evoked negative chronotropic response . The main objective of our work presented here was to determine the effects of immediate manipulation of membrane cholesterol content on M2 receptor binding properties and efficacy of signal transduction via both preferential and non preferential G proteins. To achieve this aim we used human M2 muscarinic receptors heterologously expressed in CHO cells.Membrane cholesterol content influences binding properties of muscarinic M2 receptors and differentially impacts activation of second messenger pathways 19374848 Metabolic activity and membrane permeability of attached cells grown in 24 well plates after treatments was deduced from fluorescein oxidation and calcein retention as described in .

To situate the current study theoretically, we review the phenomenon of chunking and its relation to capacity limits in working memory and then discuss aging and its effects on memory, with an emphasis on how such effects might relate to chunk formation in language processing .Several findings provide insight into which types of language stimuli young and older adults will be more likely to recall, as well as where aging deficits might be found using the measures described above. This is consistent with previous studies in which increases in stimuli meaningfulness led to improvement in chunk formation and recall (e.g., ; ) . This assumption is supported by young adults performance for the four and eight short sentence conditions, inasmuch as the number of words recalled and number of clauses accessed were comparable across these conditions, and thus constrained by a limited capacity.The assumption regarding clause access was that multiple words recalled from the same clause or 1 clause sentence are considered, tentatively at least, to form part of the same chunk in working memory. On the basis of a similar assumption about access to learned word pairs, found a roughly constant working memory capacity across learning conditions and a decrease in capacity (fewer pairs accessed) for older adults than for young adults, and we wanted to see if that result would generalize to sentence materials . Older adults should encounter difficulty in binding two words together into a cohesive unit, resulting in the observed decline in chunk size estimates.",PMC2610466.json,"previous studies show that older adults have poorer immediate recall for language but the reason is unknown. older adults may recall fewer chunks from working memory, or may have difficulty binding words together to form multi unit chunks. we examined these two hypotheses by presenting types of spoken sentences for immediate free recall, differing in the number and length of chunks per trial: short, simple sentences; such sentences; compound sentences, each incorporating two meaningful, short sentences; and random word lists, each under a sentence like intonation. older adults recalled words from (accessed) fewer clauses than young adults, but there was no aging deficit in the degree of completion of clauses that were accessed. an age related decline in working memory capacity measured in chunks appears to account for deficits in memory for spoken language.",0.4035476718403547,0.0935412026726058,0.2142645395624993

"If NMDAR mediated excitoxicity associated with ethanol withdrawal constitutes a significant fraction of the teratogenic effects of ethanol, then NMDA antagonism during withdrawal related hyperexitability should alleviate deficits associated with ethanol exposure . In support of this hypothesis, previous reports have demonstrated that administration of the non competitive NMDAR antagonist MK 801 (Dizocilpine) during the ethanol withdrawal time window following acute ethanol treatment protects against ethanol related behavioral deficits (; ; ). Cerebellar dependent behaviors appear to be particularly susceptible to ethanol exposure during the rodent brain growth spurt, in part due to substantial postnatal development in the cerebellum .This again was consistent with improved outcomes associated with MK 801 treatment during ethanol withdrawal.

The SLP RNFL profiles, in principle, should contain little or no contribution from the BVs per se.the midpoints between the superior temporal vein and artery (stva) and the inferior temporal vein and artery (itva) were determined at the location where the vessels cross the 3.4 mm circle. results blood vessel locations ranged over 39 (stva) and 33 (itva) for the 50 eyes. the location of the leading edge of the oct and slp profiles was correlated with the location of the blood vessels for both the superior [r=0.72 (oct) and 0.72(slp)] and inferior [r=0.34 and 0.43] temporal vessels.",PMC2889235.json,"purpose to determine if adjusting for blood vessel location can decrease the inter subject variability of retinal nerve fiber (rnfl) thickness measured with optical coherence tomography (oct). subjects and methods one eye of individuals with normal vision was tested with oct and scanning laser polarimetry (slp). the slp and oct rnfl thickness profiles were determined for a peripapillary circle 3.4 mm in diameter. the midpoints between the superior temporal vein and artery (stva) and the inferior temporal vein and artery (itva) were determined at the location where the vessels cross the 3.4 mm circle. the average oct and slp rnfl thicknesses for quadrants and arcuate sectors of the lower and upper optic disc were obtained before and after adjusting for blood vessel location. this adjustment was done by shifting the rnfl profiles based upon the locations of the stva and itva relative to the mean locations of all individuals. results blood vessel locations ranged over (stva) and (itva) for the eyes. the location of the leading edge of the oct and slp profiles was correlated with the location of the blood vessels for both the superior [r=0.72 (oct) and 0.72(slp)] and inferior [r=0.34 and 0.43] temporal vessels. however, the variability in the oct and slp thickness measurements showed little change due to shifting. after shifting, the difference in the coefficient of variation ranged from 2.1% (shifted less variable) to +1.7% (unshifted less variable). conclusion the shape of the oct and slp rnfl profiles varied systematically with the location of the superior and inferior superior veins and arteries. however, adjusting for the location of these major temporal blood vessels did not decrease the variability for measures of oct or slp rnfl thickness.",0.6384615384615385,0.471042471042471,0.4998957839800389
"These studies support the idea that normal variations in craniofacial morphology can affect the kinesiology of swallowing . These findings suggest that, normal anatomical variations in craniofacial morphology, particularly variations in the size and position of the mandible could affect tongue movement in swallowing. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the relationship between the Frankfort Mandibular Plane Angle (FMA) and hyoid bone displacement during liquid swallowing.The FMA was then determined by tracing lines representing the Frankfort horizontal plane and the mandibular plane and measuring their angle of convergence . The hyoid bone position at maximum forward displacement, and at maximum upward displacement, at start position, and at end position were observed and measured by using digital image analysis software (SCION Image, Scion Corp., Frederick, Maryland). The maximum forward (FD) and upward (UD) displacements of the hyoid bone for each swallow were defined as the horizontal and vertical distances (respectively) between the hyoid ending position and position of hyoid maximum displacement.The findings of this preliminary study demonstrated that the forward displacement of the hyoid bone during liquid swallowing was significantly related to craniofacial morphology. Specifically, as the Frankfort mandibular plane angle increased the forward displacement of the hyoid bone decreased.

Consistent with this goal, we utilized data from men who received YMHP as part of the original efficacy trial to test the hypothesis that partnered men would show smaller changes in target outcomes between baseline (pre intervention) and follow up (post intervention assessments conducted at 3 , 6 , 9 , and 12 months post baseline) relative to a comparison group of men who were single at the time of intervention receipt.the young mens health project (ymhp) has shown efficacy in reducing drug use and condomless anal sex (cas) with casual partners among young gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (ygbmsm). regardless of relationship status, cas with casual partners declined significantly at 12 month follow up. results suggest the incorporation of components which address relationship factors, particularly those associated with drug use, may enhance benefits of ymhp for partnered ygbmsm.There are two formats which might be used to expand YMHP for use with partnered men.

"Caries occurrence and progression is known to be influenced by a complex interplay of both environmental and genetic factors, with numerous contributing factors having been identified including bacterial flora, dietary habits, fluoride exposure, oral hygiene, salivary flow, salivary composition, and tooth structure. Given the influence of dietary habits on dental caries, we hypothesize that taste pathway genes such as genes for taste preference might influence caries risk. Therefore in the current study we investigate markers within the genes for taste receptor, type 2, member 38 (TAS2R38), taste receptor, type 1, member 2 (TAS1R2), and guanine nucleotide binding protein, alpha transducing 3 (GNAT3) for associations with dental caries in a large cohort of families from Appalachia.The transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) was used to assess association in the presence of linkage disequilibrium between the SNPs and the dental caries phenotypes. The Family Based Association Test extension of the TDT (FBAT), (; ; ) was used for both SNP and haplotype analyses (haplotypes are patterns of alleles within multiple SNPs that are together on the same chromosome strand in an individual).

"We are not aware of any studies that directly compare the risk of early institutionalization among persons with schizophrenia to persons of similar age with no mental illness. To address this gap in the research literature, we used New Hampshire Medicaid data from 1995 to 2005 to explore the following questions:Is the risk of being admitted to a nursing home higher among persons with schizophrenia than among persons with no mental illness? Does the risk of nursing home admittance for persons with schizophrenia compared with persons with no mental illness differ in middle age compared with older age?Our study sample consists solely of New Hampshire residents who are Medicaid beneficiaries.  Perhaps, the lower perceived quality of life among persons with schizophrenia compared with their peers contributes to early institutionalization as well. Despite these limitations, a significant strength of this study is our ability to analyze these data over a 10 year period and to be able to document nursing home admissions among middle aged persons with schizophrenia to peers with no mental illness .Three such models were evaluated: all ages, middle aged (4064 years only), and older aged (65 years or older). Persons with schizophrenia aged 4064 in 1995 have 3.90 times the risk of entering a nursing home compared with individuals of similar age with no mental illness.

Continuing to collect data on miRNAs implicated in mental health disorders and regulated by current therapies , in conjunction with animal studies that evaluate the perturbation of microRNA expression, may eventually elucidate vital mechanisms underlying the etiology of psychiatric illnesses.

"Paralleling the debate about the cognitive repercussions of vascular lesions, their role on mood came to light, mainly through studies of depression after stroke . More recently, the concept of vascular depression was proposed combining late onset depressive syndromes with cerebrovascular lesions and cardiovascular risk factors . After a brief summary of current knowledge regarding the cognitive impact of vascular lesions mainly based on neuropathological observations, the present review offers a detailed analysis of their repercussions on mood with special reference to the complex methodological limitations that should be considered when interpreting the experimental data in this field.Although subcortical lacunes (i.e., in the thalamus, basal ganglia and deep white matter) have repeatedly been associated with cognitive impairment , other datasets emphasize the common presence of clinically silent lacunes in very old individuals  .

Studies of cases with pure microvascular pathology are thus mandatory to isolate the cognitive impact of these lesions in brain aging (; ; ) .The concept of vascular depression was the first to suggest a shift of focus proposing that the chronic accumulation of small vascular and microvascular lesions is not a benign aging related phenomenon. More recently, a first autopsy study indicated that the severity of subcortical lacunes is also a strong determinant of PSD.

"Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is a measurement of kidney filtration and excretion that can detect decreases in organ function far earlier than more widely used markers of renal function. Also, establishment of a single GFR reference range for use in all dogs and cats may be inappropriate because filtration rate is possibly influenced by several extra renal factors, including sex, age, breed, dietary protein intake, hydration status, sodium balance, and day to day circadian rhythm.

"This self assembly process is guided by the surface tension forces at the liquid air interface, of high density, hydrophobic solutions. Hydrophilic, cell laden hydrogels were randomly placed on the surface of high density, hydrophobic solutions. These basic thermodynamic mechanisms enabled the fabrication of centimeter scale tissue structures from cell laden microscale hydrogels.In contrast, by using hydrogels, our system was able to use cell laden modules for creating engineered tissues. To address this issue a hierarchical approach was investigated to facilitate spatial control over cell placement in the engineered tissues . One negative aspect of this multi step approach was a reduced yield in complex building blocks which was balanced by the improved level of spatial control of cell deposition within the tissue like constructs.This work introduces a fabrication method for creating cell laden tissue like structures using a bottom up self assembly approach in a multi phase environment (liquid air system). This technique can be used to rapidly create tightly packed tissue like sheets with either single cell types or homogeneously distributed co culture.

"By delaying feedback up to 2s, subjects had time to make adjustments (e.g., secondary corrective saccades) to their primary saccades. We propose that different types of feedback teaching signals can invoke saccade learning. One teaching signal depends upon a tight temporal coupling with the saccade and contributes to obligatory learning independent of awareness.timing is key, as the visual error must be available shortly after the saccade is generated or adaptation does not occur. using a memory guided saccade task, we gave feedback about the accuracy of saccades that was falsely displaced by a consistent amount, but only after long delays. despite the delayed feedback, over time subjects improved in accuracy toward the false feedback.Based on past research, adaptation occurs when feedback about the accuracy of movements is available at the time of the movement, but not when feedback is delayed for more than 400 ms . Here, we provide evidence of motor learning during a memory guided saccade task with feedback delays as long as 1600 ms.

"Recent anatomical and physiological studies in macaque auditory cortex have suggested that there are parallel and hierarchical processing streams that selectively process spatial and non spatial information (see ; ). Electrophysiological studies have shown that neurons have robust responses to vocalization stimuli in the rostral belt areas of auditory cortex (e.g. ), the ventral prefrontal cortex (Romanski et l., 2004; ; ), which is the target of projections from the rostral stream. The dual stream hypothesis predicts that responses of neurons in rostral fields will have a more selective response to forward vocalizations compared to reversed vocalizations, whereas the imaging results predict that there will be robust activity to both forward and reversed vocalizations in all five cortical areas .Neurons were classified into one of five different cortical areas based on their physiological response properties of frequency selectivity and latency, by the location within the recording cylinder and by the cytoarchitectonic appearance (see ).

This was repeated for each trial for each of the 8 stimuli, as well as independently for the four forward and four reversed calls.previous single neuron studies have indicated that neurons in the rostral lateral belt respond selectively to vocalization stimuli, whereas imaging studies have indicated that selective vocalization processing first occurs in higher order cortical areas. these results are consistent with the imaging results and are inconsistent with early rostral cortical areas being involved in selectively processing vocalization stimuli based on a firing rate code. they further suggest that a more complex processing scheme is in play in these early auditory cortical areas.",PMC2614135.json,"auditory cortical processing in primates has been proposed to be divided into two parallel processing streams, a caudal spatial stream and a rostral non spatial stream. previous single neuron studies have indicated that neurons in the rostral lateral belt respond selectively to vocalization stimuli, whereas imaging studies have indicated that selective vocalization processing first occurs in higher order cortical areas. to test the dual stream hypothesis and to find evidence to account for the difference between the electrophysiological and imaging results, we recorded the responses of single neurons in core and belt auditory cortical fields to both forward and reversed vocalizations. we found that there was little difference in the overall firing rate of neurons across different cortical areas or between forward and reversed vocalizations. however, more information was carried in the overall firing rate for forward vocalizations compared to reversed vocalizations in all areas except the rostral field of the core (area r). these results are consistent with the imaging results and are inconsistent with early rostral cortical areas being involved in selectively processing vocalization stimuli based on a firing rate code. they further suggest that a more complex processing scheme is in play in these early auditory cortical areas.",0.6822033898305084,0.46808510638297873,0.4732961555450419
"With its ability to distinguish metabolically active disease, 18F FDG PET/CT can provide important adjunctive information in designing a treatment plan. The present paper focuses on the use of 18F FDG PET/ CT to improve target definition in IMRT planning.

In practice, however, this is problematic because, although the first PET/CT scan is reimbursable for the staging of many sites (NSCLC, lymphoma, head and neck cancer, esophageal cancer, melanoma, and colorectal cancer), a second scan so soon afterward usually cannot be reimbursed . This practical consideration has greatly limited the utility of 18F FDG PET/CT for radiotherapy .Radiotherapy planning has traditionally relied heavily on CT. Increasingly, 18F FDG PET/CT is also being incorporated into the treatment planning process and promises to improve the ability to confidently identify regions of disease.

"For example, a family of ATP dependent drug pumps, known as ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter proteins, can increase the resistance to chemotherapeutic agents by increasing cellular efflux.

The recent progress made in developing PXR antagonists to pharmacologically modulate PXR and thereby potentially prevent the elevation of MDR1 levels is also reviewed .Overcoming drug resistance by countering the elevated levels of MDR1 (due to drug mediated over expression) is a salvage approach. MDR1 is over expressed in cancer cells and causes drug resistance. Recently, the expression of MDR1 has been shown to be regulated by xenobiotic receptor PXR [], suggesting a role of NRs in regulating inducible drug resistance and a possible new strategy to overcome drug resistance by preventing the induction of MDR1 over expression during drug therapy instead of inhibiting the activity of total MDR1 .Drug resistance involves multiple mechanisms and targets; it is therefore impossible to overcome drug resistance by targeting a single protein.

"Investigations spanning over a century have addressed the dynamics of adipocyte energy flux and the role of glycogen metabolism in these processes. A recent publication highlighted the important yet undefined role of glycogen turnover during lipid synthesis in adipose tissue. In concert with the intervening body of literature, data from these two publications suggest a potential role of adipose glycogen metabolism as a sensing modality of adipocyte energy flux.Glycogen is also present in adipocytes albeit at much lower levels and the study of adipose glycogen metabolism has a long yet underappreciated history. Thus adipose tissue was regarded merely as a passive and inert storage depot. Upon this transition a massive, transient deposition of glycogen was observed in adipose tissue comparatively much higher than basal glycogen levels in the fed state.The dynamics of adipose tissue metabolism involve shifts in energy mobilization and storage dependent on the nutritional status of the organism. The low glycogen levels in the fed state preclude adipose glycogen from serving as a significant site of energy storage. However, more classical and current literature indicate that glycogen metabolism may function as a metabolic switch, helping to re set the lipogenic program in the adipocyte during the fasted to fed transition.",PMC2826604.json,"summary triglyceride storage in adipose tissue comprises the principal energy reserve in mammals. additionally glucose can be stored as glycogen in the fed state, primarily in liver and skeletal muscle, for mobilization during times of energy deficit. adipose tissue also contains glycogen stores albeit at very low levels. the physiological role of glycogen metabolism in adipocytes remains unclear. however, both classical literature and more recent work demonstrate that the dynamic regulation of adipose glycogen may serve as an energy sensing modality in the coordination of glucose and lipid metabolism in adipose tissue, especially during the fasted to fed transition.",0.4422442244224422,0.1727574750830565,0.2974728872638162
"Insofar as strategies implemented by hospitals to reduce readmissions among procedures targeted by the HRRP are broad based, there is the potential for their effect to spill over to other patient populations, such as those following radical cystectomy. For this reason, we assessed readmissions following radical cystectomy, stratified by a hospitals ability to reduce surgical readmissions targeted by the HRRP. Our hypothesis was that hospitals that were effective in reducing readmissions after major joint surgery may have implemented broad based initiatives with effects on non targeted surgeries .introduction and objective: readmission rates after radical cystectomy are among the highest of any surgery. the hospital readmissions reduction program (hrrp) penalizes hospitals with excess readmissions for certain targeted conditions, including total hip and knee arthroplasty. we examined whether changes made by hospitals in response to the hrrp had spillover effects on radical cystectomy readmissions.A hospitals ability to reduce readmissions following surgery targeted by the HRRP was not associated with similar reductions in radical cystectomy readmission rates.

To date, most neuroimaging studies have employed intervals ranging in duration from milliseconds to just a few seconds. We aimed at collecting empirical evidence of neurophysiological activity (time activity curves) linked to the encoding and reproduction of 9 and 18 second durations in an interval reproduction task recorded with event related fMRI .In the temporal reproduction task participants were instructed to reproduce the duration of tones (with intervals of 3, 9, and 18 s) by pressing a key when they believed that a second comparison tone had reached the length of a previously presented tone. It is crucial to control for counting strategies with which subjects keep track of time during time estimation tasks. Each participant was instructed to respond as quickly as possible to the end of the tone to equate for attention and motor preparation demands of the time reproduction task, both in the encoding and the reproduction phase.Specifically, the encoding phase activated more posterior regions in the medial frontal (including SMA) and the insular cortex. The u shaped time activity curves presented in our study show for both the 9 and the 18 second interval a peak at approximately 10 to 12 s .

"In a series of previous publications, we have developed an approach to improving density functional theory (DFT) methods based on empirical localized orbital corrections (DFT LOC). As a result, we have carefully examined the enthalpies of reaction for all of our test cases, with regard to both performance of B3LYPLOC, and in terms of possible errors in the literature estimates (experimental or derived from high level ab initio calculations) of these values. The overall average error for enthalpies of reaction, 1.2 kcal/mole, is comparable to that expected for high level ab initio methods such as G3 theory, and is likely within the error bars of the experimental and high level computational data .Localized orbital corrections for the calculation of barrier heights in density functional theory In a subsequent publication, the B3LYP LOC methodology was extended from atomization energies to ionization potentials (IP) and electron affinities (EA). Again, these parameters are physically justifiable and provide insight into the fundamental nature of DFT. Unsurprisingly, DFT's failure to accurately model nondynamical electron correlation and self interaction error contributes substantially to errors in ionization potentials and electron affinities, just as with atomization energies .The results discussed above confirm that the core B3LYP LOC approach provides high accuracy results for enthalpies of reaction, and introduce for the first time a viable model for obtaining barrier heights with this methodology. The barrier height results are comparable in accuracy to what is obtained for enthalpies of reaction, and display little fluctuation in performance across a diverse set of transition state structures and reaction chemistry.

"Similar to fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), which uses the electrical dipole dipole interaction between two fluorophores, pulsed electron electron double resonance (PELDOR) experiments measure the magnetic dipole dipole interaction between two paramagnetic centers to determine the distance between them,. Commonly, nitroxide spin labels are conjugated to proteins via specifically introduced Cys residues (site directed spin labeling). Multi frequency cw EPR mobility studies performed at room temperature found restricted mobility for several site directed spin labeled sites in lysozyme, which were rationalized by hydrophobic interactions between the spin label and other amino acids within the protein,.Pulsed Electron Electron Double Resonance Determination of Spin Label Distances and Orientations on the Tetrameric Potassium Ion Channel KcsA 19919160 Wild type KcsA and the R64C mutant were expressed and purified as described previously with a slight modification for conjugation of the spin label (1 oxyl 2,2,5,5 tetramethyl 3 pyrrolin 3 yl)methyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSL; Toronto Research Chemicals).

"It has been established that exposure to environmental toxicants may be associated with a negative impact on human health in vulnerable populations . We, and others, have hypothesized that epigenetic remodeling is a critical mechanism by which environmental toxicants alter a cell or an organism. In this manuscript, we review common environmental toxicants and their impact on the genome and epigenome, and discuss how these changes may contribute to human cancer incidence .Increasingly, epigenetics has been recognized as a key component to the onset and progression of many devastating human diseases, including cancer. There are several epigenetic mechanisms which can alter gene expression including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and miRNA expression; all of which have been shown to be induced by toxicant exposure . However, epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation, post translational modifications of histone proteins, and non coding RNA, may positively or negatively regulate gene expression, by altering the DNA packaging in the nucleosomes and ultimately regulating the binding of transcription factors.Whole genome approaches to understand DNA methylation, histone modifications, miRNA expression, and three dimensional (3D) chromatin architecture are now a mainstream part of environmental toxicant studies on normal and cancerous stem cell populations. 2) changes to covalent histone modifications and associated chromatin remodeling, and 3) non coding RNA mediated regulation of gene expression, and all three have been shown to be potentially disrupted with environmental exposures .",PMC6522338.json,"humans are exposed to a wide variety of environmental exposures throughout their lifespan. these include both naturally occurring toxins and chemical toxicants like pesticides, herbicides, and industrial chemicals, many of which have been implicated as possible contributors to human disease susceptibility [13]. we, and others, have hypothesized that environmental exposures may cause adaptive epigenetic changes in regenerative cell populations and developing organisms, leading to abnormal gene expression and increased disease susceptibility later in life [3]. common epigenetic changes include changes in mirna expression, covalent histone modifications, and methylation of dna. importantly, due to their heritable nature, abnormal epigenetic modifications which occur within stem cells may be particularly deleterious. abnormal epigenetic changes in regenerative cell linages can be passed onto a large population of daughter cells and can persist for long periods of time. it is well established that an accumulation of epigenetic changes can lead to many human diseases including cancer [46]. subsequently, it is imperative that we increase our understanding of how common environmental toxins and toxicants can induce epigenetic changes, particularly in stem cell populations. in this review, we will discuss how common environmental exposures in the united states and around the world may lead to epigenetic changes and discuss potential links to human disease, including cancer.",0.48054919908466814,0.13793103448275865,0.24802800380028958

"Familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL) is one of the most common genetic causes of hyperlipidemia (; ; ). ApoB levels are thus correlated with both LDL size and density. However, since apoB level is an independent predictor of FCHL over both LDL size and level , a portion of variation in apoB level may be influenced by variation in genes that do not directly affect these other two traits.Further evaluation of 293 SNPs across this region identified a smaller region with evidence of association with apoB in family F3. Adjustment for flanking SNPs also reduced the evidence of linkage but to a lesser extent .

"Dynamics occurring on the ns s time scale are invisible to conventional solution state NMR relaxation measurements because they are masked by global rotational diffusion. Residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) provide rich information on conformational dynamics in this timescale, and their application to RNA has recently demonstrated that the helical domains of TAR experience extensive motions that connect the conformations of TAR observed in the absence and presence of protein and small molecule ligands, . Unlike these solution state methods, solid state deuterium NMR is very sensitive to motions within the intermediate (ns s) timescale.This is consistent with the large amplitude unrestrained motions we have used to model the U25 data . The requirement that candidate motional models fit the combined relaxation and lineshape data restricts possible motional models drastically. While the fit for U25 is less satisfactory, as seen in , this model too is tightly constrained by the data.The essential functional dynamics of TAR RNA occur on a timescale (ns s) that is invisible to current solution relaxation NMR techniques, and that is also too fast to be studied by relaxation dispersion.

Dongand Krohn also showed that instrumental family support buffered against the negativeimpact of an involuntary police contact on subsequent offending among young adults.

"Numerous epidemiological studies have shown that reduced adiponectin levels correlate with increased risk of cardiovascular disease in obese individuals and in patients with diabetes and hyperglycemia. In addition to its effects on the vasculature, adiponectin is known to be cardioprotective. Rather than focusing on the insulin sensitizing effects of adiponectin, this Review will explore the effects and underlying signaling mechanisms of adiponectin in the microvasculature and myocardium .,, AMP kinase also mediates at least some of the vascular effects of adiponectin in endothelial cells, especially those involving eNOS activation. Pathways that involve protein kinase A (PKA, or cyclic AMP [cAMP] dependent protein kinase) signaling have also been implicated in the effects of adiponectin in the endothelium. These receptors are also found in endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes; they probably have a key signaling role in mediating the vascular and myocardial effects of adiponectin.The resultant cellular effects of adiponectin include enhanced NO production, and inhibition of ROS and inflammatory NFB signaling in the vasculature, as well as reduced MIR injury with suppression of TNF signaling, reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and suppression of oxidative and nitrative stress. These seemingly controversial results underscore the complexity of adiponectin signaling and suggest that multiple signaling mechanisms are involved in cardioprotection by adiponectin in adult animals in vivo . As peroxynitrite has been shown to be the most important nitrative species in causing severe nitrative stress and tissue injury, adiponectin mediated inhibition of excess peroxynitrite formation indicates that, in addition to its previously reported AMP kinase mediated metabolic and COX 2 mediated TNF suppressing actions, adiponectin might exert its anti ischemic, cardioprotective effects via inhibition of peroxynitrite induced oxidative and nitrative stress .",PMC2658652.json,"summary adiponectin is an abundant plasma protein secreted from adipocytes that elicits protective effects in the vasculature and myocardium. in obesity and insulin resistant states, adiponectin levels are reduced and loss of its protective effects might contribute to the excess cardiovascular risk observed in these conditions. adiponectin ameliorates the progression of macrovascular disease in rodent models, consistent with its correlation with improved vascular outcomes in epidemiological studies. the mechanisms of adiponectin signaling are multiple and vary among its cellular sites of action. in endothelial cells, adiponectin enhances production of nitric oxide, suppresses production of reactive oxygen species, and protects cells from inflammation that results from exposure to high glucose levels or tumor necrosis factor, through activation of amp activated protein kinase and cyclic amp dependent protein kinase (also known as protein kinase a) signaling cascades. in the myocardium, adiponectin mediated protection from ischemia reperfusion injury is linked to cyclo oxygenase 2 mediated suppression of tumor necrosis factor signaling, inhibition of apoptosis by amp activated protein kinase, and inhibition of excess peroxynitrite induced oxidative and nitrative stress. in this review, we provide an update of studies of the signaling effects of adiponectin in endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes.",0.5458422174840085,0.18415417558886507,0.28097940457148385

"In studies of children and adolescents using direct measurements of body composition, increased birthweight is associated with greater lean mass but not with fat mass. In a study of women with normal glucose tolerance levels, those who were overweight or obese in pregnancy had offspring with increased fat mass at birth. We investigated the relations between maternal size in pregnancy, early growth and body composition at the age of nine years in a cohort of children whose mothers had participated in a study of nutrition during pregnancy .We measured their height in early pregnancy using a stadiometer. In late pregnancy, we measured mid upper arm circumference on the left arm halfway between the acromion process of the humerus and the olecranon process of the ulna, with the arm relaxed alongside the body. These guidelines recommend that women with a normal pre pregnant BMI (19.8 26.0 kg/m2) should gain 12.5 18 kg, that women with a BMI of <19.8 kg/m2 should gain 12.5 18kg, that women with a BMI of 26.0 29.0 kg/m2 should gain 7 11kg and that women with a BMI >29.0 kg/m2 should gain at least 6.0kg.For one SD increase in maternal mid upper arm circumference in late pregnancy, fat mass index rose by 0.26 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.46) of a SD in boys and by 0.44 (95% CI 0.31 to 0.57) of a SD in girls.

"Enormous efforts have been devoted to use MRI to detect magnetic fields produced by neuronal currents (termed ncMRI) in human brain. This suggests that the strength of ncMRI signal may vary greatly in different animal species due to differences in their neuronal morphology and physiology.

"Brain tissue from untreated subjects with schizophrenia is rare and is usually kept in a freezer for very long periods of time. Although the Golgi method has only been successfully used with fresh or fixed tissue, here we report a new use for this technique using frozen stored tissue. We used one of the variations of the original Golgi recipe, named Golgi Cox and report its capability to produce reliable and reproducible impregnation of neurons and neuronal processes (dendrites and dendritic spines) in human brain samples kept frozen for different periods of time (1 year and 15 years).Non fixed rat brain tissue stored frozen for up to 1 year was also used. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the use of Golgi Cox in long term frozen human or rat brain tissue has been reported. We decided to use the Golgi Cox method on long term fixed human tissue trying previously some pretreatments (citrate buffer and sodium borohydride) that are commonly used to unmask antigens in immunohistochemistry, to assess if they could have any effect in the impregnation of dendrites and dendritic spines.we also applied the same technique to rat brain frozen for up to one year, obtaining the same satisfactory results. the fact that golgi cox can be successfully applied to this type of tissue adds a new value for hundreds of frozen human or animal brains kept in the freezers of the laboratories, that otherwise would not be useful for anything else. researchers other than neuroanatomists, i.e. in fields such as biochemistry and molecular biology can also benefit from a simple and reliable technique that can be applied to tissue left from their primary experiments.",PMC2637610.json,"the study of dendritic spine shape and number has become a standard in the analysis of synaptic transmission anomalies since a considerable number of neuropsychiatric and neurological diseases have their foundation in alterations in these structures. one of the best ways to study possible alterations of dendritic spines is the use of golgi impregnation. although usually the golgi method implies the use of fresh or fixed tissue, here we report the use of golgi cox for the staining of human and animal brain tissue kept frozen for long periods of time. we successfully applied the golgi cox method to human brain tissue stored for up to years in a freezer. the technique produced reliable and reproducible impregnation of dendrites and dendritic spines in different cortical areas. we also applied the same technique to rat brain frozen for up to one year, obtaining the same satisfactory results. the fact that golgi cox can be successfully applied to this type of tissue adds a new value for hundreds of frozen human or animal brains kept in the freezers of the laboratories, that otherwise would not be useful for anything else. researchers other than neuroanatomists, i.e. in fields such as biochemistry and molecular biology can also benefit from a simple and reliable technique that can be applied to tissue left from their primary experiments.",0.7207920792079209,0.5487077534791253,0.6123464109549924

When available, we extracted Kaplan Meier estimates for comparison . In this sensitivity analysis, attrition bias inflated diabetes remission rates following surgery.Although Kaplan Meier estimators assume unbiased attrition, they provide better estimates than available case estimates.

"Currently the most complete animal model for DS is the Ts65Dn mouse, which contains a partial trisomy of murine chromosome 16 confined to the region homologous to human chromosome 21. In the present study, we first examined whether long term oral memantine treatment in Ts65Dn mice would improve performance in measures of hippocampal as well as frontal cortex dependent learning and memory tasks. Therefore in addition to evaluating Ts65Dn mice via water radial arm maze (WRAM) and novel object recognition (NOR) testing, we also assessed markers of cholinergic and noradrenergic degeneration, neuroinflammation, and hippocampal morphology after a six month chronic memantine administration.Testing of mice from study 1 began 4.5 months following initiation of treatment, at 8.5 months of age (12 NS Control; 6 NS Mem; 9 Ts65Dn Control; 8 Ts65Dn Mem). This is a win stay spatial reference memory task that minimizes thigmotactic behavior, which has been documented in Ts65Dn mice [, ]. This testing procedure was established in order to facilitate rapid testing with less fatigue than other water maze paradigms.In fact, acute injections of memantine prior to NOR testing also resulted in improved memory performance in Ts65Dn mice. We found that memantine treatment (10 mg/kg, i.p.) delivered immediately prior to both training and testing sessions fully recovered recognition memory in the NOR task in Ts65Dn mice to the level of performance seen in the normosomic mice (Study 2, ).

"To the extent that behavior reflects physiological arousal, one would hypothesize that cocaine exposed infants would exhibit higher cortisol reactivity and slower recovery compared to non cocaine exposed infants . The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of prenatal cocaine and other substance exposure on infant cortisol at 7 months of infant age.

The infant was measured and weighed, and the mother was interviewed.

"Further investigations of this default mode network have demonstrated that the regions comprising the network exhibit functional connectivity (FC), that is, a temporal coherence of activity in the low frequency (< 0.1 Hz) component of the BOLD signal. Typically, when fMRI scanning is conducted concurrently with a cognitive task, the spontaneous, low frequency fluctuations in the BOLD signal are considered noise and are removed in post processing. Functional connectivity studies based on spontaneous signal fluctuations are frequently performed during a continuous resting state.As noted previously in this Discussion, although our method does not require a priori assumptions regarding the location of the relevant brain regions, the anatomical template may not be as sensitive as a voxelwise approach for detecting FC, particularly when the voxel wise connectivity levels within an anatomical region are not homogeneous. Our measure of behaviorally relevant FC averages across 13 pairs of regions involving the inferior frontal gyri, and we have not yet identified the relative contributions of individual networks to this composite measure. Our conclusions regarding white matter integrity are based on relatively low resolution, non isotropic DTI data.Older adults exhibited a significant relation between perceptual motor speed (choice RT) and FC across a distributed network of brain regions involving the inferior frontal gyri, whereas no relation between behavior and FC was evident for younger adults.

"Several simplified methods for analysis of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) by GC have been reported [, , , , ] and compared with the multiple steps conventional method that involves an extraction procedure (generally based on Folch or a modified Folch method), a methylation procedure (most often using boron trihalides), a fatty acid methyl esters extraction (commonly using hexane) and the final GC determination. It has been reported that due to the poor solubility of triacylglycerides in methanol, a further solvent is advisable, for instance hexane, if the methylation process is expected to be completed in a reasonable frame of time and that no solvent other than methanol is necessary if free fatty acids alone are to be methylated . In this study, we examined the influence of the type of BX3 used, namely BF3 and BCl3, before comparing the results of the simplified method with those obtained by the conventional multiple step protocol in the analysis of certified and non certified materials.The concentrations of the major fatty acids in human red blood cells and human serum , in salmon muscle, salmon liver and cod plasma , and in a reference material and milk powder prepared by the simplified and the conventional method and analysed by GC under the same chromatographic conditions, are expressed as mg FAME/g of sample. Experiments on whole salmon samples (results not shown) revealed differences between the conventional and the simplified method at the level of particular fatty acids such as C18:2n 6, C20:5n 3 and C20:1n 9, which could be attributed to the variable amounts of bones and skin that remain in the reactors after the methylation .

"It has recently been demonstrated that it is also possible to effect selective bond formation within the course of an ion/ion reaction to allow for covalent peptide modification in the gas phase.

"The assembly of guanine base repeats in tetrads around central cations results in the formation of higher order DNA structures known as quadruplexes. Unlike guanine quadruplexes, isoguanine quadruplexes and pentaplexes have not been studied experimentally in detail.

ESI MS analysis was performed on a Thermo LTQ mass spectrometer (San Jose, CA).

First, we aimed to corroborate our finding that near miss outcomes would recruit components of the brain reward system in regular gamblers.Four contrasts were computed to assess the outcome related brain responses in the overall group of regular gamblers: 1) All monetary wins (i.e. both participant and computer chosen trials) minus all non win outcomes. Thus, there was no detectable effect of the near miss outcomes on self report ratings in the regular gamblers .The present study investigated brain responses during a computerised slot machine task in a group of regular gamblers who varied in their involvement from recreational, social players to moderately severe probable pathological gamblers. While the SOGS score was not associated with the brain response to monetary wins, gambling severity was predicted by the neural response to near miss outcomes, in the midbrain. Although the circuitry recruited by monetary wins was strikingly similar across the two groups, the regular gamblers displayed an attenuated response to winning that was significant in the ventral striatum and medial PFC, corroborating .",PMC2929454.json,"gambling is a common recreational activity that becomes dysfunctional in a subset of individuals, with dsm pathological gambling regarded as the most severe form. during gambling, players experience a range of cognitive distortions that promote an over estimation of the chances of winning. near miss outcomes are thought to fuel these distortions. we observed previously that near misses recruited overlapping circuitry to monetary wins in a study in healthy volunteers (clark et al. 2009). the present study sought to extend these observations in regular gamblers and relate brain responses to an index of gambling severity. twenty regular gamblers, who varied in their involvement from recreational players to probable pathological gamblers, were scanned whilst performing a simplified slot machine task that delivered occasional monetary wins, as well as near miss and full miss non win outcomes. in the overall group, near miss outcomes were associated with a significant response in the ventral striatum, which was also recruited by monetary wins. gambling severity, measured with the south oaks gambling screen, predicted a greater response in the dopaminergic midbrain to near miss outcomes. this effect survived controlling for clinical co morbidities that were present in the regular gamblers. gambling severity did not predict win related responses in the midbrain or elsewhere. these results demonstrate that near miss events during gambling recruit reward related brain circuitry in regular players. an association with gambling severity in the midbrain suggests that near miss outcomes may enhance dopamine transmission in disordered gambling, which extends neurobiological similarities between pathological gambling and drug addiction.",0.5659574468085107,0.2777777777777778,0.35160735689980005

"Clinically, PD is not diagnosed until the onset of motor deficits [, ]; this has likely contributed to the dominance of motor based animal models. These symptoms include hyposmia, sleep abnormalities, gastrointestinal disturbances, anxiety, depression, autonomic dysfunction, and impaired cognition [ ]. Here, we propose a battery of behavioral tests designed to assess a larger array of behavioral symptoms .One of the most basic ways to assess the presence of a motor phenotype in a mouse model of PD is to use locomotor activity chambers. As shown in , most mouse models of PD reflect a basic motor phenotype as evidenced by decreased locomotor activity in open field behavioral chambers. While all Parkinsonian behaviors should be tested for their response to L DOPA, it is paramount that the primary motor deficits observed in mouse models respond positively to this primary PD therapeutic.These symptoms may precede the onset of motor symptoms, sometimes by years, and include anosmia, problems with gastrointestinal motility, sleep disturbances, cognitive deficits, anxiety, and depression. Most studies of widely accepted mouse models of PD only explore motor deficits; very few begin to assess non motor behaviors that are highly prevalent within the disease (see ).

"Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) promotes the transfer of cholesteryl esters from high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) to other lipoprotein particles, and individuals genetically deficient for CETP often have extremely high HDLC levels, . For example, recent work has found that those with polymorphism in PCSK9 not only have reduced levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC), but also reduced rates of vascular events. To address this issue, we evaluated more than 350,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the human genome to first determine genetic loci associated with HDLC and then evaluate whether any significant SNPs within these loci in turn impact upon rates of incident myocardial infarction during an average 10 year follow up period .We evaluated the role of polymorphisms that impact upon HDLC as potential determinants of incident myocardial infarction among participants in the prospective Womens Genome Health Study (WGHS). For the current analysis, we first ascertained those loci that contained one or more SNPs that associated with plasma HDLC at a genomewide level of statistical significance (P < 5108) and that had Hardy Weinberg P >106, minor allele frequency greater than 1 percent, and genotyping call rates greater than 90 percent. For any locus containing at least one SNP that was associated with HDLC at a genomewide level of statistical significance, we next sought evidence of association between the significant SNPs in that loci and incident myocardial infarction.Evaluating variation at 9 loci with genomewide significance for HDLC among 18,245 initially healthy American women followed prospectively over an average period of 10 years, we found that common SNPs exclusively in or near the CETP gene were also associated with risk of incident myocardial infarction.

The evaluation was performed in terms of accuracy and variation in accuracy of residence time estimates obtained from the phantom populations.For each phantom and at each time point, we applied three different organ activity quantification methods: the conventional planar (CPlanar), the quantitative planar (QPlanar), and the quantitative SPECT processing methods (QSPECT). In the QPlanar method, the true 3D organ VOIs from the phantom configurations were used to overcome the overlap problem in the CPlanar method. The projection of each organs VOI, scaled so that there was unit total activity was calculated using a projector which models image degrading effects including attenuation, scatter, and full collimator detector response.Using this phantom population, we evaluated various residence time estimation methods. The results indicated that the processing methods differed both in terms of their average accuracy and the variation of the accuracy over the population of phantoms.

"Current biopsy chosocial approaches to understanding the experience of pain view it as a dynamic and complex interaction of biological, psychological, and social forces. To date, overwhelming evidence identifies catastrophizing, which is a set of negative emotional/cognitive processes that involve rumination and pessimism, perceptions of helplessness, and magnification of pain related symptoms as a critically important risk factor for adverse pain related outcomes. Collectively, this review highlights several potentially important neurophysiologic mechanisms by which catastrophizing may shape the experience of pain .Mindbody interactions in pain: the neurophysiology of anxious and catastrophic pain related thoughts 19218091 Some other studies have provided evidence that catastrophizing may exert a broad influence on physiologic responses to pain, and that its influence may extend across multiple systems. Temporal summation of pain (ie, the increase of perceived pain intensity when repetitive noxious stimuli are delivered), which a frequently studied index of central pain facilitation, is also influenced by catastrophizing. In a sample of patients with back pain, higher catastrophizing was associated with a blunted diurnal cortisol rhythm, a maladaptive neuroendocrine profile that may indicate a poor pain related prognosis.Taken together, this literature provides demonstrative evidence for complex neuroendocrine, neuroimmune, psychophysiologic, and functional neuroanatomic effects of catastrophizing on the pain experience. Research that examines both physiological and psychosocial factors and how they shape long term pain outcomes is an exciting area for future study and highlights the truly biopsychosocial nature of the pain experience.

"How this interaction triggers TCR signaling, however, has eluded researchers for the more than two decades since the TCR was cloned . Taking this into consideration, we propose the receptor deformation model of TCR triggering . In this model, mechanical forces induce conformational changes in the TCR CD3 complex that favor downstream signaling events.T cell receptor triggering by force The most compelling evidence for concealed ITAMs in unstimulated T cells comes from a recent report that looked into the interaction between CD3 and lipids . In these mice, because of the lack of Lck sequestration by coreceptors, T cells have markedly greater amounts of free Lck and much increased TCR signaling upon TCR engagement. Taking into account the data described above, this suggests that TCR CD3 conformational change is the most likely explanation for receptor triggering .We propose that TCR triggering is intimately coupled with the motor system of T cells, which generates mechanical forces not only to help T cells find specific pMHCs through cell motility, but also to initiate TCR signaling through receptor deformation. The receptor deformation model of TCR triggering is consistent with the indispensable role of actin and myosin in TCR signaling [, ].

"Previously considered intracellular depots where cells store neutral lipids, mostly triglycerides (TG) and cholesteryl esters (CE) to be used in times of need, we currently understand lipid droplets (LDs) as dynamic functional organelles. LDs play crucial roles in cellular energy balance and in the regulation of other important cellular processes []. OXPAT is also known as myocardial LD protein (MLDP) and as lipid storage droplet protein 5 (LSDP5).Among the PAT proteins that are expressed in the myocardium (ADFP, TIP47, S3 12, and OXPAT), OXPAT deserves particular attention. An argument against this being the case with the exchangeable PAT proteins is the fact that, although TIP47 is ubiquitously expressed, the tissue distribution of S3 12 and OXPAT is noticeably different, with higher S3 12 expression in white adipose tissue, a tissue specialized in lipid storage, while OXPAT is predominantly expressed in lipid consuming tissues. Nevertheless, since S3 12 is also expressed in heart, albeit at a relatively low level, it is possible that different combinations of exchangeable PAT proteins on the surface of LDs in cardiomyocytes might facilitate the storage or use of TG depending on the myocardial energy requirements under different physiologic situations.Additionally, many other proteins outside the PAT family also coat LDs. Just as OXPAT is particularly enriched on myocardial LDs, so there may be other cardiac enriched LD proteins that influence cardiac lipid metabolism.

"This simple condensation can be conducted either offline or in the presence of Au substrates, permitting DAMs to be assembled from amines in a single step. The kinetics and saturation coverage of DAM assembly were measured by second harmonic generation (SHG) analysis, and collated with atomic surface densities measured by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The adsorption of DTCs proceeded with first order kinetics and achieved surface coverages comparable to that of alkanethiols, but notable differences were observed with respect to rate and adsorbate concentration.Remarkably, the rate of DTC adsorption did not change with concentration as anticipated for Langmuir adsorption kinetics (see ), despite the good fit of the SHG data to a first order process (see ). In contrast, the adsorption of EG6 SH onto Au proceeded much more rapidly than any of the DTC adsorbates, and obeyed Langmuir kinetics in a concentration dependent fashion. Freshly oxidized Au surfaces are both electron rich and highly reactive, enabling the electrostatic adsorption of the alkylammonium counterions to compete with DTC chemisorption during formation of the initial adlayer (see ).The in situ condensation of alkylamines and CS2 into DTCs offers a practical and versatile method for DAM assembly on Au surfaces.

"Many MS methods employ hydrogen/deuterium amide exchange (HDX), which also has been widely used to determine protein conformations, binding interfaces, and dynamics []. PLIMSTEX (Protein Ligand Interaction by Mass Spectrometry, Titration and H/D Exchange), previously developed in the Gross laboratory, tracks changes in the extent of protein HDX at various ligand/protein ratios to give affinity, stoichiometry and conformational changes that occur upon ligand binding []. The approach also provides information on the minimum number of amino acids constituting the epitope at the binding interface .We chose calmodulin and its binding to  endorphin as a model system to evaluate dPLIMSTEX and to compare it with traditional PLIMSTEX. The dilution approach employed in dPLIMSTEX allows one to minimize the quantity of macromolecule used in the determination for a certain system compared to that used in traditional PLIMSTEX. Because dPLIMSTEX uses the peptide mass as readout for HDX, this function gave the relationship for the average HDX mass of the ligand peptide, D, that was expressed by the deuterium shifts of the ligand molecules from each species, as shown in  .a new methodology using hydrogen/deuterium amide exchange (hdx) to determine the binding affinity of protein peptide interactions is reported. the method, based on our previously established approach, plimstex (protein ligand interaction by mass spectrometry, titration and h/d exchange) [j. am. chem. soc. 2003, 125, 52525253], makes use of a dilution strategy (dplimstex) for hdx, using the mass of the peptide ligand as readout. we employed dplimstex to study the interaction of calcium saturated calmodulin with the opioid peptide endorphin as a model system; the affinity results are in good agreement with those from traditional plimstex and with literature values obtained by using other methods.",PMC2932787.json,"a new methodology using hydrogen/deuterium amide exchange (hdx) to determine the binding affinity of protein peptide interactions is reported. the method, based on our previously established approach, plimstex (protein ligand interaction by mass spectrometry, titration and h/d exchange) [j. am. chem. soc. 2003, 125, 52525253], makes use of a dilution strategy (dplimstex) for hdx, using the mass of the peptide ligand as readout. we employed dplimstex to study the interaction of calcium saturated calmodulin with the opioid peptide endorphin as a model system; the affinity results are in good agreement with those from traditional plimstex and with literature values obtained by using other methods. we show that the dplimstex method is feasible to quantify an antigen antibody interaction involving a 3 nitrotyrosine modified peptide in complex with a monoclonal anti nitrotyrosine antibody. a dissociation constant in the low nanomolar range, was determined, and a binding stoichiometry of antibody/peptide of 1:2 was confirmed. in addition, we determined that the epitope in the binding interface contains a minimum of five amino acids. the dplimstex approach is a sensitive and powerful tool for the quantitative determination of peptide affinities with antibodies, complementary to conventional immuno analytical techniques.",0.6265560165975104,0.4666666666666666,0.5054851614229555

Initially, both the utricular and saccular maculae increased in area at about the same rate during early embryonic development, as shown in . Little growth occurred between days E6 and E7, however both maculae doubled in size between E7 and E8.Later in development, hair cell density actually decreased from E8 to E10; likely due to the rapid growth in size of the epithelium .

"The use of a variety of neuroanatomical techniques has led to a greater understanding of the adverse effects of stress on psychiatric health. One recent advance that has been particularly valuable is the development of resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) in clinical studies. The current study sought to build on this finding and apply RSFC to the study of the long term effects of early life stress, a mechanism relevant to a vast array of psychiatric disorders.The F1 pups were left in the cage during the intruder presentation and the CSS F1 pups were exposed to depressed maternal care from their F0 mothers and the daily conflict between the mother and the male intruder (Early life CSS, ECSS) . The F1 control and ECSS females of the current study were the offspring of the F0 control and CSS dams; the differences between the treatments of the control and ECSS F1 females were limited to the exposure of the ECSS F1 females to depressed maternal care and daily conflict between their F0 mothers and the male intruders during age 216 days.

"Trypanosoma evansi, an important camel pathogen, belongs to subgenus Trypanozoon, a group of trypanosomes with diverse mammalian hosts (Desquesnes et al. 2013; Ngaira et al. 2003). The parasite is also believed to have originated from Africa where, presently, it causes the trypanosomiasis (surra) in camels, horses, cattle, buffaloes, small ruminants and dogs (Ngaira et al. 2003) Surra is therefore endemic in many tropical and subtropical countries wherever biting fly vectors are present. The aim of the present study therefore was to generate data that would enhance our understanding of virulence in T. evansi towards the development of novel approaches for management of the disease in camels .summary this study assessed the virulence of trypanosoma evansi, the causative agent of camel trypanosomiasis (surra), affecting mainly camels among other hosts in africa, asia and south america, with high mortality and morbidity. evansi isolates collected from surra endemic countries. we determined parasitaemia, live body weight, packed cell volume (pcv) and survivorship in mice, for a period of 60 days post infection.The present study demonstrated the existence of different levels of virulence in T. evansi isolates from Kenya which ranged from low, moderate to high.

"The synthesis and release of renin are the key regulated steps of the renin angiotensin system cascade, which (through the generation of angiotensin II) regulates blood pressure and fluid/electrolyte homeostasis. In adult mammals, the main source of circulating renin is the kidney, where renin is synthesized, stored in granules, and released from juxtaglomerular (JG) cells. In recent years, many advances have been made in understanding the mechanisms that control renin synthesis, renin release, and cell identity.Those abnormalities may be due to the lack of renin cells combined with the lack of CBP and p300 in cells from the renin lineage. As mentioned above, cells from the renin lineage have the plasticity to switch back and forth from the renin phenotype. These mice showed normal distribution of renin during development and recruitment concomitantly with the appropriate expression of CFP in cells derived from the renin lineage (ie, arteriolar smooth muscle cells) and expression of YFP within the renin cells.In summary, renin cell identity, renin synthesis, and renin release depend on multiple events centrally regulated by cAMP at the transcriptional and post transcriptional levels.

In the present study, we evaluated the effects of CDB4124 on the proliferation and apoptosis in cultured human uterine leiomyoma smooth muscle (LSM) cells and control myometrial smooth muscle (MSM) cells from matched uteri .Treatment with 10 8 10 6M CDB4124 for 48 h significantly reduced Bcl 2 mRNA levels in LSM but not in MSM cells . Treatment with CDB4124 for 72 h markedly decreased Bcl 2 protein expression in LSM cells; its expression, however, was not affected in MSM cells . In summary, CDB4124 decreased Bcl 2 expression in LSM but not in MSM cells in a time and dose dependent manner.objective to evaluate the effects of selective progesterone receptor modulator cdb4124 on cell proliferation and apoptosis in cultured human uterine leiomyoma smooth muscle (lsm) cells and control myometrial smooth muscle (msm) cells in matched uteri. in matched msm cells, however, cdb4124 did not affect cell proliferation or apoptosis. conclusion(s) cdb4124 selectively inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in lsm but not in msm cells.",PMC2872031.json,"objective to evaluate the effects of selective progesterone receptor modulator cdb4124 on cell proliferation and apoptosis in cultured human uterine leiomyoma smooth muscle (lsm) cells and control myometrial smooth muscle (msm) cells in matched uteri. design laboratory research. setting academic medical center. patient(s) premenopausal women (n=12) undergoing hysterectomy for leiomyoma related symptoms. intervention(s) treatment of primary lsm and msm cells with cdb4124 (10 8 10 6m) or vehicle for 24, or hours. main outcome measure(s) western blot for protein expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (pcna), cleaved poly adenosine 5 diphosphate ribose polymerase (parp), bcl 2 and krppel like transcription factor (klf11); mtt assay to evaluate viable cell numbers; and real time polymerase chain reaction to quantify mrna levels. result(s) treatment with cdb4124 significantly decreased levels of the proliferation marker pcna, the number of viable lsm cells, and the anti apoptotic protein bcl 2. on the other hand, treatment with cdb4124 increased levels of the apoptosis marker cleaved parp and the tumor suppressor klf11 in a dose and time dependent manner in lsm cells. in matched msm cells, however, cdb4124 did not affect cell proliferation or apoptosis. conclusion(s) cdb4124 selectively inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in lsm but not in msm cells.",0.6084788029925187,0.41102756892230574,0.4795626053896125
"Hence, the present study focuses on the development of an approach to model fiber and sheet dispersions using an invariant based framework. A previously published orthotropic and invariant based model, which characterizes the nonlinear passive behavior of myocardium , is here augmented with structure parameters allowing the quantification of the degree of dispersion based on measured fiber and sheet angle data. Because the degree of dispersion is significantly elevated under various cardiac pathologies there is a need to consider dispersion when modeling myocardial tissue in diseased states .This may not be suitable in pathological cases with increased fiber dispersion. It is certainly possible to retrieve individual dispersion parameters; however, the increased dispersion obtained from the HCM sample was only seen within small focal islands throughout the myocardial wall [, ]. Available data show sheet and fiber dispersions averaged over all islands found in a given ventricle, but no data on the spatial distribution and morphology of such islands are available.There are several reports in the literature, which provide evidence for the presence of dispersion in the fiber and sheet orientations in myocardial tissues. An approach that couples the fiber and sheet orientations is feasible; however, specific data are missing. Although the effects of using fiber and sheet dispersion parameters for the healthy myocardium were fairly minor, the use of fiber dispersions relating to a pathological myocardium had a rather big effect.",PMC3970090.json,"summary we present an approach to model the dispersion of fiber and sheet orientations in the myocardium. by utilizing structure parameters, an existing orthotropic and invariant based constitutive model developed to describe the passive behavior of the myocardium is augmented. two dispersion parameters are fitted to experimentally observed angular dispersion data of the myocardial tissue. computations are performed on a unit myocardium tissue cube and on a slice of the left ventricle indicating that the dispersion parameter has an effect on the myocardial deformation and stress development. the use of fiber dispersions relating to a pathological myocardium had a rather big effect. the final example represents an ellipsoidal model of the left ventricle indicating the influence of fiber and sheet dispersions upon contraction over a cardiac cycle. although only a minor shift in the pressurevolume (pv) loops between the cases with no dispersions and with fiber and sheet dispersions for a healthy myocardium was observed, a remarkably different behavior is obtained with a fiber dispersion relating to a diseased myocardium. in future simulations, this dispersion model for myocardial tissue may advantageously be used together with models of, for example, growth and remodeling of various cardiac diseases.",0.5976470588235294,0.2222222222222222,0.3438953736575791
"Earlier recognition of CKD could slow progression of CKD, prevent complications, and reduce cardiovascular related outcomes; additionally, early referral to a nephrologist has been shown to improve outcomes for those who progress to end stage renal disease () . Here, we review previous work in CKD awareness and examine the need for future research to guide the implementation of further dissemination and policymaking efforts. CKD awareness can be broadly categorized as community or patient level awareness and provider level awareness, each of which is discussed in detail below.Provider level CKD awareness includes both general understanding of CKD, its risk factors, and associated complications/consequences and knowledge of patient management strategies to slow CKD progression. Having a routine provider and health insurance were not associated with awareness of CKD status . Finally, the effect of exposure to health related media, through which most awareness campaigns would operate, on patient CKD awareness has not been explored .Despite these challenges, further studies are essential to fully understand the factors and consequences associated with CKD awareness. However, because such studies will take time, efforts to increase awareness through dissemination of basic CKD information, may need to be implemented simultaneously with these studies, given the high prevalence of CKD and its risk factors . Further exploration of the factors associated with decreased CKD knowledge and the impact of CKD awareness on individual patient outcomes and public health outcomes is necessary to guide awareness efforts moving forward.",PMC2864779.json,"earlier recognition of chronic kidney disease (ckd) could slow progression, prevent complications, and reduce cardiovascular related outcomes. however, current estimates of ckd awareness indicate that both patient and provider level awareness remain unacceptably low. many of the factors that are possibly associated with ckd awareness, which could help guide implementation of awareness efforts, have yet to be fully examined. also, little is known regarding whether increased patient or provider awareness improves clinical outcomes or whether there are possible negative consequences of awareness for ckd patients. further research is necessary to continue to design and refine awareness campaigns aimed at both patients and providers, but there is an immediate need for dissemination of basic ckd information, given both the high prevalence of ckd and its risk factors and the low estimated awareness of ckd.",0.4959568733153639,0.23848238482384826,0.3651578552891851
