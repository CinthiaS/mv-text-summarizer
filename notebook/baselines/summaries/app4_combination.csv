"The average age of the world population is on the rise. By the year 2050, an estimated 21.1% (>2 billion) of the worlds population will be over the age of 60 . As the population grows older, age related diseases such as cognitive impairment present huge challenges to society .Two cohorts of participants were simultaneously and independently recruited from the same community. Printed leaflets, brochures, and community recruitment stations were used to recruit participants. In one cohort, participants were recruited and randomized to the Tai Chi Chuan or control group.102 older adults were recruited for this study. Of the 90 participants who passed screening and finished baseline scans, 62 (21 in the Tai Chi Chuan group, 16 in the Baduanjin group, 25 in the control group) completed all study procedures. Four participants dropped out of the Tai Chi Chuan group (1 due to movement, 1 due to contraindications to the MRI scan, 2 due to scheduling conflicts).",PMC5659386.json,"the aim of this study is to investigate and compare how 12 weeks of tai chi chuan and baduanjin exercise can modulate brain structure and memory function in older adults. magnetic resonance imaging(mri) and memory function measurements (wechsler memory scale chinese revised, wms cr)were applied at both the beginning and end of the study. results showed that both tai chi chuan and baduanjin could significantly increase grey matter volume (gmv) in the insula, medial temporal lobe (mtl), and putamen after 12 weeks of exercise. no significant differences were observed in grey matter volume (gmv) between the tai chi chuan and baduanjin groups. we also found that compared to healthy controls, tai chi chuan and baduanjin significantly improved visual reproduction subscores on the wms cr. baduanjin also improved mental control, recognition, touch and comprehension memory subscores of the wms cr compared to the control group. memory quotient (mq)and visual reproduction subscores were both associated with gmv increases in the putamen and hippocampus. our results demonstrate the potential of tai chi chuan and baduanjin exercise for the prevention of memory deficits in older adults.",0.32069970845481055,0.10557184750733137,0.24694034039489607
"The development of sepsis creates a substantial health care burden and limited epidemiologic information exists with regard to postoperative sepsis. Martin et al. demonstrated that the incidence of sepsis and the number of sepsis related deaths are increasing, although the overall mortality rate among patients with sepsis is declining. The National Healthcare Quality Reports estimated 11.6 cases of post operative sepsis per 1,000 elective surgery discharges with hospital length of stay longer than 3 days.The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) was queried for the years 2002 2006. This database was developed as part of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) and sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Being the largest all payer hospital database in the United States it contains information about all hospitalizations from more than 1,000 acute care hospitals representing a 20% weighted probability sample of all US hospitals.An estimate of 6,512,921 elective surgical cases met the eligibility criteria.

"Withdrawal from nicotine precipitates neurocognitive deficits such as impaired working memory . Working memory is a limited capacity system responsible for active maintenance and manipulation of information, and is a component of a wide range of cognitive processes . Of relevance to nicotine dependence, working memory facilitates top down executive control and behavioral inhibition through active maintenance of task related goals .23496760 The neuroimaging experiment used a within subject design with two BOLD fMRI sessions in counterbalanced order: (1) smoking as usual (<45 minutes between last cigarette and BOLD imaging) and (2) 24 hours abstinent. The 24 hour time frame was selected because most relapses to smoking occur during this period . Sessions were scheduled at the same time of day (+/ 3 hours) 1 3 weeks apart; subjects were required to complete both scanning sessions prior to beginning a six week smoking cessation program involving behavioral counseling.In the largest sample of adult smokers studied to date for nicotine abstinence effects on working memory in an fMRI study, we report poorer performance and decreased brain activation during abstinence across regions comprising a task related working memory circuit . The extent of reduction in BOLD signal in the MF/CG mediated the effect of abstinence on accuracy but not response time. Seed based connectivity between the MF/CG and other regions in the task network was also reduced during abstinence compared to smoking.",PMC3701751.json,"nicotine withdrawal is associated with subtle working memory deficits that predict subsequent relapse. we examined the neural substrates underlying these processes in treatment seeking smokers, and explored the moderating influence of age on abstinence induced alterations in brain activity and performance. sixty three smokers participated in two blood oxygen level dependent (bold) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) scans while performing a visual n back task on two separate occasions: smoking as usual and after hours of biochemically confirmed abstinence (order counterbalanced). abstinence (versus smoking) led to reduced accuracy, slower median correct response time, and reduced bold signal change in the a priori regions of interest (rois): medial frontal/cingulate gyrus and right and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. significant age x session effects were found for bold signal change in all three regions, as well as for withdrawal and craving; for all measures, abstinence effects were attenuated in smokers aged >50 years compared to those < years old. these results suggest that abstinence effects on neurocognitive function may be more pronounced for younger smokers, and may indicate a new avenue for research exploring mechanisms underlying age differences in smoking cessation success.",0.38369304556354916,0.05301204819277109,0.19888881815150572
"When a brief stimulus repeats periodically on a short time scale, its repetition can generate perceptual experiences known as beats. Although the experience of a beat is most commonly associated with repetition of musical sounds, a comparable experience can also be reliably generated by repeated presentation of brief visual stimuli (; ; ). However, beat perception with modalities other than vision and audition has attracted little attention.To determine whether subjects used optimal criteria as defined by , we tested the proposition that the error rate for 3 Hz stimuli [Pr(fast | slow stimulus)] and the error rate for 6 Hz stimuli [Pr(slow | fast stimulus)] would be sufficiently similar within each noise level as to be reasonably considered equivalent . Using equivalence bounds of (0.0768, 0.0768), calculated with n = 23 subjects at 80% power and  = 0.05, Two One Sided Tests (TOST) for equivalence were significant in all noise levels at  = 0.05 [0% noise: t(22) = 1.93, p = 0.034; 20% noise: t(22) = 2.52, p = 0.01; 40% noise: t(22) = 2.88, p = 0.004], allowing us to conclude that the observed difference between proportions of the two types of errors was statistically equivalent to zero. depicts these results as mean difference values (black squares) in each noise level, with 90% TOST confidence intervals falling within the established equivalence bounds.3.1.

"Human and mouse studies have proven that high levels of cholesterol rich remnants cause atherosclerosis, but the relevance of triglyceride rich lipoproteins (TRLs) to atherogenesis remains controversial. In part, this controversy stems from the fact that elevated levels of TRLs and remnants often coexist . Humans with chylomicronemia have severe hypertriglyceridemia but low levels of cholesterol rich remnants.Gpihbp1/ mice (>90% C57BL/6) were housed in a barrier facility and fed a 4.5% fat chow diet. We also bred apo B48only and apo B100only Gpihbp1/ mice (Gpihbp1/ Apob48/48, Gpihbp1/ Apob100/100). All experiments were approved by the Animal Research Committee .GPIHBP1 deficient mice develop severe chylomicronemia as a result of defective lipolysis of triglyceride rich lipoproteins. In this study, we address two timely and important issues.

"Although irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a multi symptom disorder, abdominal pain is its defining characteristic and is a predominant feature of the IBS illness experience.  Unlike other IBS symptoms, such as bloating or abnormalities in stool frequency or form, abdominal pain independently drives health related quality of life (HRQOL) decrements in IBS and is the principal driver of patient reported symptom severity. In a recent study of 755 IBS patients in a University setting, we found that abdominal pain, as measured using a 21 point numeric rating scale (NRS), was the most powerful predictor of patient perceived severity among 25 tested clinical factors.The outcome measure of this study was a 10 point abdominal pain numeric rating scale (NRS) with the following directions: How much abdominal pain have you felt today, on a scale from 1 (none) to 10 (very severe). This is a modification of the 11 point NRS supported by the Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) for the non IBS pain literature, and as further evaluated in a meta analysis by Farrar and colleagues. The FDA has recently proposed use of a similar 11 point NRS for IBS drug trials using a scale from 0 (none) to 10 (worst possible pain) to describe the worst abdominal pain episode from the past 24 hours. The FDA suggests collecting daily abdominal pain NRS data for 7 consecutive days and then calculating a 7 day mean NRS to establish the end of study pain rating.10.1111/j.1365 2036.2009.04144.x Figure 1Proportion of Patients Achieving a Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) for Key Variables Stratified by Pain Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) Responder Status. Each set of bars depicts the results of an individual longitudinal 22 table, and demonstrates the difference in MCID achievement between NRS responders vs. non responders over the 3 month study period. For example, 46% of NRS responders achieved an MCID in distension, whereas only 15% of NRS non responders achieved an MCID in distension (31% difference in response; p=0.002).",PMC2793273.json,"background controversy exists about how to effectively measure patient reported outcomes in ibs clinical trials. pain numeric rating scales (nrs) are widely used in the non ibs pain literature. the fda has proposed using the nrs in ibs. aim to test the psychometrics of an abdominal pain nrs in ibs. methods we analyzed data from a longitudinal cohort of rome iii ibs subjects. at entry, subjects completed a 10 point nrs, bowel symptoms, ibs severity measurements (ibsss, fbdsi), health related quality of life indices (ibs qol, eq5d), and the worker productivity activity index (wpai). we repeated assessments at months along with a response scale to calculate the minimal clinically important difference (mcid). results there were subjects (82% women; age=4215) at baseline and at months. the nrs correlated cross sectionally with ibsss (r=0.60; p<0.0011), fbdsi (r=0.49; p<0.0001), ibs qol (r=0.43; p<0.0001), eq5d (r=0.48; p<0.0001), presenteeism (r=0.39; p<0.0001), absenteeism (r=0.17; p=0.04), and distension (r=0.46; p<0.0001), but not stool frequency or form. the mcid was 2.2 points, correlating with a 29.5% reduction over time. conclusions an abdominal pain nrs exhibits excellent validity and can be readily interpreted with an mcid in patients with ibs. these data support the use of the nrs in ibs clinical trials.",0.40830449826989623,0.12500000000000003,0.2323605123685384
"Ubiquitous in biological systems and protein pharmaceuticals, isoaspartic acid (isoAsp, isoD or  Asp) in peptides and proteins arises from either deamidation of asparagine (Asn) or isomerization of aspartic acid (Asp) via a common succinimide intermediate, as depicted in .  Formation of isoAsp inserts an extra methylene group into the protein backbone, resulting in a beta peptide linkage.  As a consequence, a kink in the protein conformation is generated, potentially leading to altered functions of the protein.a ubiquitous yet underappreciated protein post translational modification, isoaspartic acid (isoasp, isod or asp), generated via the deamidation of asparagine or isomerization of aspartic acid in proteins, plays a diverse and crucial role in ageing, as well as autoimmune, cancer, neurodegeneration and other diseases. in addition, formation of isoasp is a major concern in protein pharmaceuticals, as it may lead to aggregation or activity loss. the scope and significance of isoasp have, up to now, not been fully explored, as an unbiased screening of isoasp at low abundance remains challenging.This paper presents a general workflow for isoAsp analysis that comprises the following steps. First, a sample, e.g., tryptic digest, is treated with endoprotease Asp N that cleaves Asp. Second, the resulting mixture and the original sample are analyzed by LC MS to determine all peptides which sequences contain Asp but are resistant to Asp N cleavage.",PMC2936825.json,"a ubiquitous yet underappreciated protein post translational modification, isoaspartic acid (isoasp, isod or asp), generated via the deamidation of asparagine or isomerization of aspartic acid in proteins, plays a diverse and crucial role in ageing, as well as autoimmune, cancer, neurodegeneration and other diseases. in addition, formation of isoasp is a major concern in protein pharmaceuticals, as it may lead to aggregation or activity loss. the scope and significance of isoasp have, up to now, not been fully explored, as an unbiased screening of isoasp at low abundance remains challenging. this difficulty is due to the subtle difference in the physicochemical properties between isoasp and asp, e.g., identical mass. in contrast, endoprotease asp n (ec 3.4.24.33) selectively cleaves aspartyl peptides but not the isoaspartyl counterparts. as a consequence, isoaspartyl peptides can be differentiated from those containing asp and also enriched by asp n digestion. subsequently, the existence and site of isoaspartate can be confirmed by electron transfer dissociation (etd) mass spectrometry. as little as 0.5 % of isoasp was detected in synthetic beta amyloid and cytochrome c peptides, even though both were initially assumed to be free of isoasp. taken together, our approach should expedite the unbiased discovery of isoasp.",0.6370023419203747,0.4658823529411764,0.5492321600739458
"Cysteine residues have highly reactive thiol groups and are thus prone to modifications, including oxidation, nitrosylation, or glutathionylation. For example, disulfide bond formation, due to the oxidation of pairs of cysteines, is critical for protein folding and maintaining three dimensional structures.  Additionally, disulfide heterogeneity, including formation of non native disulfide bonds from disulfide scrambling, as well as the occurrence of lanthionines or trisulfide bridges, is of concern in the production and shelf life of protein reagents and pharmaceuticals.20049891 Since the  elimination reaction requires disulfide bridges, reduction of disulfides should prevent cysteine desulfurization. As can be seen from , no formation of dehydroalanine was detected under commonly applied experimental conditions for protein reduction, i.e. DTT at 60 C for 30 minutes. TCEP, a water soluble phosphine, is often used as an alternative reducing reagent for reduction of disulfide bonds; but unlike DTT, the reduction by TCEP should be effective at room temperature.The goal of this paper was to examine cysteine modifications induced during the sample preparation for protein characterization, specifically the conversion of cysteine to dehydroalanine for example during disulfide mapping; and cysteine to alanine when heating with TCEP. To study these modifications, atriopeptin, a small 23 amino acid peptide was first selected as a model compound. Atriopeptin contains only a single disulfide bond, and thus, after tryptic digestion without reduction, two peptides linked by a disulfide bond are formed, with minimal potential interference of the non cysteine peptides, see .",PMC2908508.json,"in this paper, we have examined two cysteine modifications resulting from sample preparation for protein characterization by ms: (1) a previously observed conversion of cysteine to dehydroalanine, now found in the case of disulfide mapping and (2) a novel modification corresponding to conversion of cysteine to alanine. using model peptides, the conversion of cysteine to dehydroalanine via elimination of a disulfide bond was seen to result from the conditions of typical tryptic digestion (37 c, ph 7.0 9.0) without disulfide reduction and alkylation.. furthermore, the surprising conversion of cysteine to alanine was shown to occur by heating cysteine containing peptides in the presence of a phosphine (tcep). the formation of alanine from cysteine, investigated by performing experiments in h2o or d2o, suggested a radical based desulfurization mechanism unrelated to elimination. importantly, an understanding of the mechanism and conditions favorable for cysteine desulfurization provides insight for the establishment of improved sample preparation procedures of protein analysis.",0.4623115577889447,0.12626262626262627,0.24130496753269803

"More than fifty years ago, it was discovered that aspirin inhibits platelet activation by preventing platelet thromboxane synthesis and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) secretion  mechanisms which amplify platelet activation via surface receptors []. Based upon those discoveries, dual anti platelet therapy (DAPT), consisting of aspirin and a P2Y12 receptor antagonist are the standard of care in the treatment of STEMI and NSTEMI [] . Failure of platelet antagonists to have their anticipated effect in some patients has been attributed to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes encoding proteins responsible for metabolism of P2Y12 antagonists [, ], for cyclooxygenase enzymatic activity, in aspirin transporters, and in aspirin absorption [].Blood was taken from patients immediately upon presentation with STEMI or NSTEMI and compared to healthy volunteer subjects. Plasma was isolated and biomarker concentration was evaluated by ELISA. Patients with STEMI or NSTEMI were given 325 mg aspirin at least 30 minutes prior to blood draw.To our knowledge, this the first investigation of platelet receptor function and post receptor signaling comparing patients presenting with STEMI to NSTEMI immediately upon arrival following only aspirin monotherapy and prior to percutaneous instrumentation. Platelets from patients presenting with STEMI were found to be different from patients with NSTEMI, with residual platelet activation observed following aspirin treatment in both groups, but with different platelet receptor agonist sensitivities and with different post receptor signaling properties.

Hemolymph was collected from two day old fifth instar larvae into saturated ammonium sulfate at 4C. Ammonium sulfate was adjusted to 55% saturation, and precipitated proteins were pelleted by centrifugation.The goal of this study was to determine the specific immune functions of M. sexta transferrin. We based our hypotheses mainly on the well established immune functions of mammalian lactoferrin. We found no evidence that M. sexta transferrin has direct bactericidal activity, but our results indicate that insect transferrin has bacteriostatic activity that is dependent on its ability to chelate iron .",PMC5292288.json,"transferrins are secreted proteins that bind iron. the well studied transferrins are mammalian serum transferrin, which is involved in iron transport, and mammalian lactoferrin, which functions as an immune protein. lactoferrin and lactoferrin derived peptides have bactericidal activity, and the iron free form of lactoferrin has bacteriostatic activity due to its ability to sequester iron. insect transferrin is similar in sequence to both serum transferrin and lactoferrin, and its functions are not well characterized; however, many studies of insect transferrin indicate that it has some type of immune function. the goal of this study was to determine the specific immune functions of transferrin from manduca sexta (tobacco hornworm). we verified that transferrin expression is upregulated in response to infection in m. sexta larvae and determined that the concentration of transferrin in hemolymph increases from m to m following an immune challenge. it is also present in molting fluid and prepupal midgut fluid, two extracellular fluids with immune capabilities. no immune induced proteolytic cleavage of transferrin in hemolymph was observed; therefore, m. sexta transferrin does not appear to be a source of antimicrobial peptides. unlike iron saturated lactoferrin, iron saturated transferrin had no detectable antibacterial activity. in contrast, m iron free transferrin inhibited bacterial growth, and this inhibition was blocked by supplementing the culture medium with m iron. our results suggest that m. sexta transferrin does not have bactericidal activity, but that it does have a bacteriostatic function that depends on its iron sequestering ability. this study supports the hypothesis that insect transferrin participates in an iron withholding strategy to protect insects from infectious bacteria.",0.4439024390243903,0.21568627450980393,0.3411243216845412
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease with chronic inflammation in the synovium of the joint tissue. This inflammation leads to joint destruction, disability and shortened life span. Defining key cellular subsets and their activation states in the inflamed tissue is a critical step to define new therapeutic targets for RA.We created mass cytometry datasets for analysis by concatenating cells from all individuals for each cell type. For donors with more than 1,000 cells, we randomly selected 1,000 cells to ensure that samples were equally represented. In this way, we created downsampled datasets of 25,161 fibroblasts from 23 patients, 15,298 monocytes from 26 patients, 19,985 T cells from 26 patients, and 8,179 B cells from 23 patients for analysis.Using multi model, high dimensional synovial tissue data we defined stromal and immune cell populations overabundant in RA and described their transcriptional contributions to essential inflammatory pathways. Recognizing the considerable variation in disease duration and activity, treatment types, and joint histology scores, we elected to use a molecular parameter, based on percent leukocytes of the total cellularity, to classify our samples at the local tissue level. We note that differences in leukocyte enrichment of joint replacement samples and biopsy samples were best explained by leukocyte infiltration and not by the histological scores (, ) .",PMC6602051.json,"to define the cell populations that drive joint inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis (ra), we applied single cell rna sequencing (scrna seq), mass cytometry, bulk rna seq and flow cytometry to t cells, b cells, monocytes and fibroblasts from samples of synovial tissue from patients with ra or osteoarthritis. utilizing an integrated strategy based on canonical correlation analysis of 5,265 scrna seq profiles, we identified unique cell populations. combining mass cytometry and transcriptomics together revealed cell states expanded in ra synovia: thy1(cd90)+hla drahi sublining fibroblasts, il1b+ pro inflammatory monocytes, itgax+tbx21+ autoimmune associated b cells and pdcd1+ t peripheral helper (tph) and t follicular helper (tfh). we defined distinct subsets of cd8+ t cells characterized by a gzmk+, gzmb+ and gnly+ phenotype. we mapped inflammatory mediators to their source cell populations; for example, we attributed il6 expression to thy1+hla drahi fibroblasts, and il1b production to pro inflammatory monocytes. these populations are potentially key mediators of ra pathogenesis.",0.35978835978835977,0.07446808510638298,0.21005242453923922

"Despite initial resuscitation rates of 4067%, in hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) outcomes remain poor with less than 20% of victims surviving to hospital discharge.  Many cardiac arrest victims who achieve return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) eventually succumb to a post resuscitation syndrome characterized by hemodynamic instability, maladaptive inflammation, metabolic derangements, and impaired neurological recovery. Glucose homeostasis and insulin mediated signaling are important in the pathophysiology of critical illness and may be useful as a determinant of outcomes following resuscitation from cardiac arrest.Derangements in Blood Glucose Following Initial Resuscitation from In Hospital Cardiac Arrest: A Report from the National Registry of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation 19297067 This study has several limitations. Given the retrospective design of this study, we were unable to establish a causal relationship between hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and survival outcomes. Also, since pre arrest measurements were not available in this NRCPR database, it is possible that some of the observed derangements in glucose actually preceded their index arrest events.Our results suggest that hyperglycemia is common following IHCA in both diabetics and non diabetics. Furthermore, survival odds in diabetics may be relatively insensitive to large variations in blood glucose with decreased survival only associated with extreme (> 240 mg/dL, > 13.3 mmol/L) hyperglycemia. By comparison, survival in non diabetics appears more sensitive to derangements in blood glucose outside a range of minimum (71  170 mg/dL, 3.9  9.4 mmol/L) and maximum (111  240 mg/dL, 6.2  13.3 mmol/L) glucose values.",PMC2722106.json,"summary study aims hyperglycemia is associated with poor outcomes in critically ill patients. we examined blood glucose values following in hospital cardiac arrest (ihca) to 1) characterize post arrest glucose ranges, 2) develop outcomes based thresholds of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, and 3) identify risk factors associated with post arrest glucose derangements. methods we retrospectively studied 17,800 adult ihca events reported to the national registry of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (nrcpr) from january 1, through february 1, 2007. results data were available from 3,218 index events. maximum blood glucose values were elevated in diabetics (median mg/dl [iqr, 307 mg/dl], 12.5 mmol/l [iqr 9.2 17.0 mmol/l]) and non diabetics (median mg/dl [iqr, 239 mg/dl], 9.78 mmol/l [iqr 7.5 13.3 mmol/l]). unadjusted survival to hospital discharge was higher in non diabetics than diabetics (45.5% [95% ci, 43.3 47.6%] vs. 41.7% [95% ci, 38.9 44.5%], p = .037). non diabetics displayed decreased adjusted survival odds for minimum glucose values outside the range of 170 mg/dl (3.9 9.4 mmol/l) and maximum values outside the range of 240 mg/dl (6.2 13.3 mmol/l). diabetic survival odds decreased for minimum glucose greater than mg/dl (13.3 mmol/l). in non diabetics, arrest duration was identified as a significant factor associated with the development of hypo and hyperglycemia. conclusions hyperglycemia is common in diabetics and non diabetics following ihca. survival odds in diabetics are relatively insensitive to blood glucose with decreased survival only associated with severe (> mg/dl, > 13.3 mmol/dl) hyperglycemia. in non diabetics, survival odds were sensitive to hypoglycemia (< 70mg/dl, < 3.9 mmol/l).",0.5131086142322098,0.2368421052631579,0.31215000891445116

"Diffusion really includes three fairly distinct processes: Presentation of the new culture element or elements to the society, acceptance by the society, and the integration of the accepted element or elements into the preexisting culture . Ralph Linton, 1936, p. 334.Diffusion is a natural social phenomenon that happens with or without any particular theory to explain it. In fact, whether the innovation involves a new idea, new pattern of behavior, or a new technology, it is also a natural physical phenomenon as well, one that describes the spread of an object in space and time .The diffusion of consequential innovations always has been understood to be a social process. Although knowledge is often gained through the largely one way communication of information especially with the increased information search capabilities of new communication technologies, persuasion occurs through the two way communication of social influence, most commonly in the form of local informal opinion leaders who are embedded in social networks. For innovations perceived to be high in risk or uncertainty, information alone in one on one counseling, training workshop, practice guideline, presentation, Web site, brochure, etc., is typically insufficient to move the individual toward a positive decision or even serious contemplation of innovation costs and benefits (; ; ).As it has increasingly been applied to agricultural, international development, public health, and educational interventions, classical diffusion of innovation theory is evolving into a science of dissemination. I have highlighted seven concepts from the diffusion literature that have been used or have the potential to be used to affect the rate at which social work interventions spread: The perceptions of social work interventions can be shaped through formative evaluation assessments of attribute categories that in turn can be used to design and redesign interventions and communication messages about them .

"When data have been obtained from individuals who constitute intact social groups (e.g., members of the same family, students attending the same neighborhood school, or patients seen by the same physician), the individuals responses are not statistically independent. Indeed, as a result of prior selection, common exposure, and/or mutual influence, the responses of any two randomly selected group members tend to be more similar to one another than the responses of any two randomly selected individuals from the parent population (; ; ; ; ). Failure to account for these dependencies during a studys planning phase and when the data are analyzed can result in a seriously underpowered study, underestimated SEs, inflated test statistics, and actual Type I error rates that are many times larger than the nominal Type I error rates.In the 1950s, design based survey statisticians developed statistical theory and methods that addressed the analytic challenges they confronted when their random sampling plan involved stratification, clustering, and the selection of units with unequal probability at one or more stages . With this design based approach, a researcher did not have to specify a distributional model in order to obtain consistent estimates of population regression parameters.

"A subset of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the head and neck presents as cystic masses in the neck. Often, distinguishing between these cystic metastases of SCC from benign cystic neck lesions, such as branchial cleft cyst, can be very challenging. Squamous lining cells in benign cystic lesions may, at times, exhibit significant cytologic atypia, raising concern for SCC.Four of 11 SCC cases in the test set exhibited diffuse, strong staining with p16INK4A . The p16INK4A positive cases arose from primary oropharyngeal nonkeratinizing SCC (3 cases) and a nonkeratinizing SCC of unknown primary site of origin (1 case). In all positive FNAB cases, diffuse, strong p16INK4A was identified in neoplastic cell clusters and also in scattered nucleated malignant cells dispersed singly .Although the diagnosis of metastatic SCC involving neck lymph nodes usually poses little diagnostic difficulty, the subgroup of cystic metastases is often challenging for pathologists, especially in those patients without a prior diagnosis of malignancy, where distinguishing cystic SCC from branchial cleft cysts is critical.

"Chitin ( () poly N acetyl D glucosamine) is widely distributed in nature and is the second most abundant polysaccharide after cellulose.

"Cysteine rich protein (CRP) 2 is a member of the LIM only CRP family with two tandem LIM domains. On the basis of the prominent cytoskeletal association, a cytoarchitectural role has been proposed for CRP proteins and was demonstrated in mice lacking CRP3/MLP; those mice developed dilated cardiomyopathy with dramatic disruption of cardiomyocyte cytoarchitecture. In addition to a potential cytoarchitectural function, CRP2 also has nuclear functions by strongly enhancing serum response factor (SRF) mediated smooth muscle (SM) gene expression.As SRF mediates the activity of Csrp2 intron 1 and that SRF coactivators, which include myocardin, myocardin related transcription factor A (MRTF A/MKL1) and B (MRTF B/MKL2), play important roles in regulating transcription of SRF target genes, we hypothesized that SRF coactivators may participate in the regulation of CRP2 expression. C terminal deletion of the transactivation domain of MRTF A (DN A630 and DN A723) function as dominant negative mutants and are effective in repressing SRF coactivator induced transactivation of the SM22 promoter.

"Temperature and pain are generally considered to be separate sensory systems served by different receptors and afferent fibers. The sensitivities to warmth and cold are attributed to stimulation of specific warm fibers and cold fibers (; ; ) that have thresholds in the range of normal resting skin temperatures (ca. 2535C), whereas nociceptive sensations such as burning, stinging or pricking are attributed to stimulation of temperature sensitive nociceptors that have high thresholds and respond to noxious heat or cold. However, recent data indicate that cooling the skin to temperatures as mild as 2831C or heating it to just 37C can evoke nociceptive sensations of stinging, pricking or burning.In both experiments all subjects received practice in the psychophysical task prior to data collection.

"The Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation 2 Diabetes (BARI 2D) is a randomized clinical trial initiated to evaluate treatment strategies for diabetes and coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with both of these conditions. In 1996, post hoc analyses of the original Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation (BARI) randomized trial demonstrated that multivessel coronary disease patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus had lower survival relative to those without diabetes regardless of the form of revascularization and that CABG was associated with better survival than PTCA without stents in patients with diabetes. Since most BARI patients had unstable angina and all required revascularization, the optimal treatment approach was unknown for patients with stable coronary disease whose symptoms did not require urgent revascularization.There were few statistically significant and no clinically important baseline differences between the randomized treatment groups.

"Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's Disease with Dementia (PDD) are both characterized by significant cognitive impairment and movement abnormalities. The primary pathology associated with DLB and PDD are Lewy neurites and Lewy body inclusions that are primarily composed of  synuclein aggregation. Both diseases are associated with profound cognitive deficits as well as motor impairment, and the primary clinical distinction is the relative timing of the onset of cognitive relative to motor symptoms, with the onset of cognitive symptoms occurring less than one year after the onset of motor symptoms in DLB and greater than one year in PDD .The CVLT was administered using the methods described in the standardization manual . Briefly, the CVLT is a word list learning task that consists of two 16 item word lists, one of which (list A) is presented over 5 learning trials (e.g., auditory presentation and immediate recall) and a second (list B) presented on a single learning trial. Following the recall of list B, subjects are asked to recall list A spontaneously (short delay free recall) and following semantic cues (short delay cued recall), and after a 20 minute delay they are again asked to recall list A spontaneously (long delay free recall) and following semantic cues (long delay cued recall).The main finding from the present study was that patients with DLB and patients with PDD differed in certain aspects of the verbal learning and memory deficits they exhibited. In particular, DLB patients were more impaired than the PDD patients on all but one of the recall measures, a finding that was highlighted by the fact that DLB patients displayed a more rapid rate of forgetting than that of PDD patients.

"The ability to classify multiple objects (e.g. pixels in an image) simultaneously is essential for certain estimation tasks. Within a Bayesian framework, each object (site in MRF nomenclature) is modeled as a random variable, and the collection of these random variables (under minor conditions) is called a Markov random field (MRF). If the random variables are assumed independent, we can estimate each in isolation.10.1016/j.media.2012.06.007 The brain MR image, unlike the images for CaP detection, contain three classes: CSF (1), GM (2), and WM (3). Segmentation performance depends upon the choice of weights (1), (2), and (3). Since only relative ratios of weights are relevant, we can, without loss of generality, restrict the weights as follows: (16)(1)+(2)+(3)=1and(1),(2),(2)[0,1].Notice that the ROC curves/surfaces produced by MWMAPICM and MWMPMMC are similar. This is not unexpected since both implementations have related underlying cost functions. Specifically, they identify the MAP and MPM estimates of the same random variable X (see Section 3.1).",PMC3508385.json,"many estimation tasks require bayesian classifiers capable of adjusting their performance (e.g. sensitivity/specificity). in situations where the optimal classification decision can be identified by an exhaustive search over all possible classes, means for adjusting classifier performance, such as probability thresholding or weighting the a posteriori probabilities, are well established. unfortunately, analogous methods compatible with markov random fields (i.e. large collections of dependent random variables) are noticeably absent from the literature. consequently, most markov random field (mrf) based classification systems typically restrict their performance to a single, static operating point (i.e. a paired sensitivity/specificity). to address this deficiency, we previously introduced an extension of maximum posterior marginals (mpm) estimation that allows certain classes to be weighted more heavily than others, thus providing a means for varying classifier performance. however, this extension is not appropriate for the more popular maximum a posteriori (map) estimation. thus, a strategy for varying the performance of map estimators is still needed. such a strategy is essential for several reasons: 1) the map cost function may be more appropriate in certain classification tasks than the mpm cost function, 2) the literature provides a surfeit of map estimation implementations, several of which are considerably faster than the typical markov chain monte carlo methods used for mpm, and 3) map estimation is used far more often than mpm. consequently, in this paper we introduce multiplicative weighted map (mwmap) estimation achieved via the incorporation of multiplicative weights into the map cost function which allows certain classes to be preferred over others. this creates a natural bias for specific classes, and consequently a means for adjusting classifier performance. similarly, we show how this multiplicative weighting strategy can be applied to the mpm cost function (in place of the strategy we presented previously), yielding multiplicative weighted mpm (mwmpm) estimation. furthermore, we describe how mwmap and mwmpm can be implemented using adaptations of current estimation strategies such as iterated conditional modes and mpm monte carlo. to illustrate these implementations, we first integrate them into two separate mrf based classification systems for detecting carcinoma of the prostate (cap) on 1) digitized histological sections from radical prostatectomies and 2) t2 weighted tesla ex vivo prostate mri. to highlight the extensibility of mwmap and mwmpm to estimation tasks involving more than two classes, we also incorporate these estimation criteria into a mrf based classifier used to segment synthetic brain mr images. in the context of these tasks, we show how our novel estimation criteria can be used to arbitrarily adjust the sensitivities of these systems, yielding receiver operator characteristic curves (and surfaces).",0.31960461285008235,0.06611570247933883,0.19876107113099198
"More and more prospective epidemiological studies collect and store biological specimens for future use.

"The delivery of genes into the CNS offers an attractive potential option for the treatment of various neurological disorders. Efficient distribution of therapeutic vectors within the brain is critical, especially in diseases that may require neuronal targeting of large anatomical regions of the brain (e.g., neurodegenerative diseases, lysosomal storage disorders, and stroke). Viral vectors that are able to convey robust gene transfer must be combined with efficient brain delivery systems for effective translation of gene therapy technology into the clinic .Animals were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (25 mg/kg, intravenous) and killed 4 weeks after AAV1 hrGFP administration.

"In resource limited settings, nevirapine (NVP) based regimens are often used for prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV 1 (pMTCT). Use of these regimens is associated with the emergence of NVP resistant variants in many infants who are HIV infected despite prophylaxis, which can compromise future treatment with a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) containing regimen. Recent studies in adults suggest that the presence of minority variants may be associated with a poor response to subsequent antiretroviral therapy.We first compared the results of two assays performed at Johns Hopkins University: ViroSeq and LigAmp.

More recently, evidence has appeared that dimensions of character are also heritable and may influence the risk for schizotypy  .10.1016/j.schres.2008.06.025 Group differences for the domains of psychopathology, neurocognition, temperament and character were assessed using a mixed model with group, gender, and age as fixed effect predictors. The mixed model (PROC MIXED, SAS 9.1) estimated the covariance in the residuals due to the sibling relationships, allowing for a heterogeneous covariance structure for the two sets of sibling pairs. Post hoc comparisons between groups were examined when a significant main effect was present (based on Type III statistics).Schizophrenia research 18718739 The Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) is a self report measure with 240 true/false items measuring four domains of temperament (i.e., NS, HA, RD, PS) and three domains of character (i.e., SD, CO, ST).

"Diversity of T cells posttransplant has been studied primarily by the flow cytometric detection of T cell receptor  chain families (with variable region specific monoclonal antibodies) or by spectratyping, ie, electrophoretic detection of various lengths of the  chain complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) segments of rearranged  chain genes. ,, With both techniques, the repertoire of posttransplant T cells appears skewed, ie, some T cell clones appear overrepresented while others appear absent. This is particularly prominent in the first several months posttransplant and in patients having received T cell depleted grafts (eg, in vivo with antithymocyte globulin or ex vivo by CD34 cell enrichment of the graft).Three individuals were studied: a 46 year old female with systemic sclerosis (SSc) undergoing autologous CD34 cell transplantation using conditioning with cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg), total body irradiation (TBI) (8 Gy) and antithymocyte globulin (ATG) (90 mg/kg), a 28 year old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) undergoing autologous CD34 cell transplantation using the same conditioning, and a healthy 44 year old male (control). The two patients were selected from a cohort of 56 patients undergoing transplantation for SSc or MS based on their willingness to undergo research apheresis at 1 and 12 months posttransplant. As the transplantation was performed for autoimmune diseases, it was designed to be maximally lymphoablative.The unexpectedly large number of CD4 T cell clones early posttransplant and the persistence of herpesvirus specific CD8 T cell clones from pretransplant to posttransplant may explain why infections in autologous transplant recipients following neutrophil engraftment are relatively rare. It also questions whether clinical stabilization or improvement of patients with autoimmune diseases after autologous transplantation is due to the conditioning induced elimination of most T cell clones (including those causing the disease). On the one hand, conditioning intensity appears to be inversely related to the likelihood of autoimmune disease progression, suggesting that debulking of pathogenic T cell clones may be beneficial.",PMC2704065.json,"t cell diversity posttransplant is thought to be severely restricted, based on t cell receptor chain immunophenotyping or spectratyping. using chain sequencing, we studied cd4 t cell diversity in two adult patients undergoing lymphoablative conditioning with cyclophosphamide, total body irradiation and antithymocyte globulin and autologous transplantation of hematopoietic cells depleted of t cells by enrichment for cd34 cells. the indication for the transplant was systemic sclerosis or multiple sclerosis. pretransplant, the estimated number of distinct chains (the minimum number of cd4 t cell clones in the person) was 600,000 to 700,000, which was similar to a healthy control. it was 200,000 to 500,000 at one month and 400,000 to 1,600,000 at twelve months posttransplant. in conclusion, t cells early after lymphoablative conditioning and autologous cd34 cell transplantation may be more diverse than previously appreciated, possibly because many t cell clones survive the conditioning or are reinfused with the graft. thus, the therapy may not be completely t lymphoablative.",0.47817047817047825,0.17536534446764093,0.29450124186874443

"Motion artifact is a long standing problem for MRI for which a number of prospective and retrospective correction strategies have been implemented . Motion correction of High Angular Resolution Diffusion Imaging (HARDI) is absolutely necessary because substantial vibrations from diffusion weighting gradients and long scan duration result in head movement comparable to or larger than the voxel size. However, as each image volume in a HARDI acquisition exhibits different image contrast due to differences in diffusion weighting, standard motion correction strategies may not work .Quantitative Assessment of Motion Correction for High Angular Resolution Diffusion Imaging 19695824 Images from HARDI datasets are rarely examined directly.

"Progress in understanding the cell biology of regulatory T cells (Treg) came with the discovery of the X chromosome encoded gene forkhead box p3 (Foxp3) during efforts to identify the genetic basis for the autoimmune disorder in human patients suffering from immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X linked syndrome and in the spontaneous mouse mutant scurfy. Mice harboring a loss of function mutation in the Foxp3 gene are affected by fatal early onset of lymphoproliferative immune mediated disease involving multiple organs and tissues. Moreover, subsequent studies showed that sustained Foxp3 expression in mature Treg is required for their maintenance and suppressive function. Interestingly, diminished Foxp3 expression by Treg, as a result of gene targeting, led to the acquisition of effector T cell functions, including production of interleukin (IL) 2, IL 4, IL 17 and interferon (IFN),, whereas forced expression of the Foxp3 gene in CD4+ non Treg cells is sufficient to acquire suppressive function in vitro and in vivo. Together, these studies are consistent with the notion that Foxp3 has a pivotal role in defining Treg function .Interestingly, the lapsed Treg acquire effector functions. For example, Treg activated in vitro in the presence of IL 6 lost Foxp3 expression and differentiated into IL 17 producing cells. The effector functions these cells may acquire in vivo are diverse, as summarized in .In summary, a number of experiments indicate a degree of plasticity in Foxp3 + Treg and these cells can acquire diverse effector functions, some of which are intestine specific, such as the TFH function found in Treg accumulating in the Peyers patches. Interestingly, much of the evidence for Treg obtaining effector functions was observed in studies in which colitis was induced following cell transfer to lymphopenic mice.

"Renal disease presents a unique opportunity to study complex human disease in an integrative manner. With renal biopsy tissue available for molecular analysis, tissue and disease specific gene expression can be used for the analysis and interpretation of kidney disease associated genetic variants, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).

One approach to this task is to characterize a group of disease associated SNPs with functional and/or pathways analysis to define the mechanisms underlying the associations and link putative risk genes to the disease phenotype. The premise underlying analysis of gene expression and GWAS datasets is that renal disease phenotypes manifest renal tissue specific changes in transcript regulation, and so the integration of mRNA expression from renal tissue will help focus the analysis.The integration of gene expression with disease GWAS is an important strategy to deciphering the regulatory mechanisms leading to disease phenotypes.

"Despite the increase in the work done on masculinity theory over the past two decades, the subject of masculinity in later life has not been well studied. Recently, this lack of research into older mens masculinity was highlighted in a special issue of the Journal of Aging Studies (December 2007) which helped fill gaps in the literature. The current paper contributes to research in this area.The Interaction of Masculinity and Control and its Impact on the Experience of Suffering for an Older Man 20161225 To begin, we will discuss masculinity. Masculinity is a cultural construct that may be defined at its core by certain physical features and an inner sense of being male. It is also characterized by certain behavioral and affective traits such as toughness, power, control, independence, differentiation from womanhood, restricted emotions, physical and sexual competence, assertiveness, and aggressiveness, among other characteristics.Our case study reveals that masculinity is related to control, and that these constructs continually interact over ones lifetime to lead to suffering as well as to protect against suffering. Those experiences which caused suffering for Mr. Gregor may be different from the experiences that would cause others suffering. There is a continuum along which different individuals will report suffering.",PMC2703496.json,"previous work suggests that control and suffering are related to one another. although it would be expected that within cultures which emphasize the importance of masculinity, as well as personal control, there would be greater suffering among individuals who lose their sense of masculinity or control, how these constructs relate to each other and are individually negotiated has been largely understudied. this paper takes a case study approach to further exploring how the constructs of control, masculinity, and suffering are related in the lived experience of an older european american man, mr. gregor. analysis of this case shows that masculinity is related to control and that these constructs act as themes which interact over mr. gregors lifetime in a variety of ways. the level of control maintained by mr. gregor in different aspects of his life affects his sense of suffering. in some instances his sense of masculinity helps to protect mr. gregor against suffering; in others, it contributes to his suffering. these findings support the notion that there are culturally dependent possibilities for how control and masculinity are related.",0.503896103896104,0.1409921671018277,0.29240104434902237
"Circadian rhythms describe the roughly 24 hour oscillation of many physiological properties, behaviors, and gene transcription that has arisen through evolution to coordinate the activities of biological organisms with the periods of light and dark corresponding to day and night (, ). Mechanisms to control circadian rhythms exist in many if not most organisms, from plants to human, with some mechanisms highly conserved and others perhaps evolving convergently. While much work is ongoing regarding the function of sleep in humans, it is clear that sleep is an essential physiological process, the lack of which causes or exacerbates a plethora of conditions ranging from causing a bad day to worsening neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinsons disease (PD) and Alzheimers disease (AD).None 30729219 Manganese (Mn) is a metal that occurs commonly in soil and water. It is one of the most abundant elements in the earths crust. It has been used since antiquity as a pigment in ceramics.Many metals are essential for the optimal functional of many physiological processes, including countless enzymatic reactions that use metals as cofactors. Those metals that play a role in biological processes, including but not limited to manganese, copper, and zinc, are tightly regulated at the level of absorption, transport into and out of the cell, and excretion. Even with regulation, excessive levels of these metals can occur, in the case of high levels of environmental exposure, such as in industrial settings, or in the case of disease in which the regulation of the metal is impaired.",PMC6361389.json,"circadian rhythms describe the behavioral and physiological changes that occur in living organisms in order to attune to a hour cycle of day and night. the most striking aspect of circadian function is the sleep wake cycle, however many other physiological processes are regulated in hour oscillations, including blood pressure, body temperature, appetite, urine production, and the transcription and translation of thousands of circadian dependent genes. circadian disruption and sleep disorders are strongly connected to neurodegenerative diseases including parkinsons disease, alzheimers disease, and huntingtons disease as well as others. metal exposures have been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, in some cases involving metals that are essential micronutrients but are toxic at high levels of exposure (such as manganese, copper, and zinc), and in other cases involving metals that have no biological role but are toxic to living systems (such as lead, mercury, and aluminum). in this review, we examine the evidence for circadian and sleep disorders with exposures to these metals and review the literature for possible mechanisms. we suggest that giving the aging population, the prevalence of environmental exposures to metals, and the increasing prevalence of neurodegenerative disease in the aged, more research into the mechanisms of circadian disruption subsequent to metal exposures is warranted.",0.5098901098901099,0.12803532008830024,0.3203818265012971

"Diabetes has been shown to increase the risk of plantar ulceration, and subsequently a disproportionate amount of amputations occur in this population. In order to improve treatment options, a better understanding of changes that occur in the presence of this disease from both a pathological and biomechanical standpoint is needed. Our group and several others have examined diabetes induced changes in the elastic parameters of the plantar soft tissue.Linear mixed effects regression was used to assess differences in stress relaxation coefficients and raw data parameters by condition (diabetic vs. non diabetic) or plantar location (calcaneus vs. other). Stress relaxation coefficients (A, B, C1, C2, 1, x2) and raw data parameters (initial, mid, and end slopes as well as normalized area) were the dependent variables, while condition or plantar location was the independent fixed effect, and subject was the random effect.

"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a clustering of metabolic abnormalities that places individuals at an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes, and related complications. Although it has been variously defined, MetS generally refers to the presence of 3 or more of the following risk factors: central adiposity (large waist circumference), hypertriglyceridemia, reduced high density lipoprotein cholesterol, elevated resting blood pressure, and hyperglycemia. Mexican Americans, and, particularly, Mexican American women,, are at high risk for the development of MetS, with prevalence estimates of 51% to 54% in middle aged Mexican American women, compared with 33% to 37% in non Latino White women.Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were measured with the Omron HEM 705CP, an oscillometric automatic measurement device (Omron, Vernon Hills, IL), via standard research procedures. Waist circumference was assessed with a flexible tape measure positioned in a horizontal plane on the patients bare abdomen at the narrowest part of the torso. Medical records were reviewed for high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL cholesterol), serum triglycerides, and plasma glucose, recorded within 3 years of the enrollment date.Descriptive statistics were calculated, and all variables were examined for deviations from normality.

Although the specific nature of the tasks assigned to these offices is widely discrepant, all are united by the highly demanding nature of their work and their routine exposure to both physical and psychological stressors (e.g. ; ).There are several limitations to the present investigation. Firstly, because the data are cross sectional, there is a necessary caution in that the provided model cannot assert causal relationships. Rather, the model suggests avenues for future longitudinal studies to investigate and confirm .The present study highlights multiple pathways for first responders to increase their well being in the face of work stress.

Importantly, many of the different mouse models present with similar, stress induced clinical phenotypes as observed in humans and are excellent models for pathophysiological studies relevant to human patients.MITOCHONDRIAL FATTY ACID OXIDATION DISORDERS: PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL STUDIES IN MOUSE MODELS 20532823 Energy deficiency due to impaired long chain fatty acid oxidation especially affects high energetic organs such as the heart or skeletal muscle. Disease episodes occur in situations of increased energy demand such as exercise or illnesses when energy from carbohydrates has been used up and fatty acid oxidation is activated to provide energy from fat. Exil and coworkers have shown in different tissues from VLCAD deficient mice that mitochondrial proliferation appears to be compensating for impaired  oxidation and energy deficiency .As reviewed here the mouse models representing a range of enzyme deficiencies in the FAO pathway have been instrumental in our further understanding of the pathophysiology of these disorders in human patients. These studies point the way to new therapies or preventive measures for this group of potentially fatal disorders affecting children .

The positive association between longer sex work involvement and USC suggests that FSWs who work longer may develop maladaptive coping mechanisms for sex work related stressors as they are exposed to HIV risk behaviours (Although the data are not presented, 79% of drug using FSWs were involved in sex work for more than 1 year) .",PMC3883761.json,"female sex workers (fsws) in china are exposed to multiple work related harms that increase hiv vulnerability. using mixed methods, we explored the social ecological aspects of sexual risk among fsws in beijing. sex work harms were assessed by property stolen, being underpaid or not paid at all, verbal and sexual abuse, forced drinking; and forced sex more than once. the majority (90%) reported at least one type of harm, 38% received harm protection from mommies (i.e., managers) and 32% reported unprotected sex with clients. in multivariate models, unprotected sex was significantly associated with longer involvement in sex work, greater exposure to harms, and no protection from mommies. mommies protection moderated the effect of sex work harms on unprotected sex with clients. our ethnography indicated that mommies played a core role in sex work networks. such networks provide a basis for social capital; they are not only profitable economically, but also protect fsws from sex work harms. effective hiv prevention interventions for fsws in china must address the occupational safety and health of fsws by facilitating social capital and protection agency (e.g., mommies) in the sex work industry.",0.43052837573385516,0.19646365422396858,0.26231980300875357
"One critical variable in understanding the transmission dynamics of most arboviruses is the extent to which virus persists in either the vector or host for extended periods (, , , ). Long term persistence potentially allows arboviruses to survive when local conditions (e.g., winter climate in the Northern hemisphere) interrupt transmission. The ability of viruses to persist as chronic infections in vertebrate hosts (, ) or in eggs or larvae of vectors (, , ) has been studied extensively, but less is known about how long most arboviruses are routinely maintained in adult arthropods.Swallow bugs clustering at the entrances of abandoned, intact cliff swallow nests were collected from site NN (from all nests) when it was inactive on 9 May 2004, 31 May 2004, and 14 May 2005 and from site CS (from about half the nests) on 24 May 2009 by brushing the bugs into a wide mouthed collecting jar.

"Effective radioprotectors are needed for biomedical applications as well as for radiation disaster countermeasures. One approach to the discovery of novel radioprotectors is to identify and investigate the efficacy of potentially novel naturally occurring radioprotector molecules. One such molecule is trypanothione, a unique diglutathionyl spermidine conjugate found in kinetoplastids within the suborder Trypanosomatida .Transgenic Biosynthesis of Trypanothione Protects Escherichia coli from Radiation Induced Toxicity The T. cruzi expression plasmids encoding trypanothione synthetase, pET15b TcTryS (Ampr), and trypanothione reductase, pBRT, were a generous gift from Dr. Alan Fairlamb (University of Dundee, Scotland) (, ). For simplicity, pET15b TcTryS plasmid is referred to as pETA/TS in this paper. The TR gene was PCR amplified from the pBRT vector using the following PCR primers: TcRed forward: TTCCAGAAGAATCATGATGTC, and TcRed reverse: CTCTTTCCTTACAGAGATGCC.Trypanosomes have long been known to be one of the most radioresistant eukaryotic organisms. It requires 100 Gy of X rays to render the T. cruzi strain noninfectious and 600 Gy of X rays to destroy the T. gambiense parasite (, ).

A recent meta analysis which examined endogenous sex hormones and prostate cancer did not find an association between androgens and estradiol and prostate cancer risk, although this collaborative analysis did not specifically report results for estrone and prostate cancer risk likely in part due to the fact that few studies have studied this relationship .

"Advancements in cancer biomarker research parallel the development of technologies. In recent years, great strides in genomic and proteomic analytical methods have uncovered highly complex signaling networks that contribute to disease onset and progression. In turn, the diverse pathophysiology of cancers and the heterogeneous nature of tumors illustrate the compound effect that genetic and protein alterations have on oncogenic signaling .30556752 The proteome is dynamic and protein composition is continuously modified through highly regulated processes such as transcription, translation, and degradation in response to cell cycle progression and other stimuli. Proteomic assessment at any given time is only representative of the current state of the cells and proteins whose abundance is low at that point can be missed by mass spectrometry based proteomic analysis. Additionally, proteins with impaired function and/or abnormal conformation can be highly susceptible to degradation, thus rendering them undetectable by proteomic techniques.Cancer biomarker discovery efforts have benefited from technological improvements in instrumentation and the implementation of novel analytical methods. Examples are the development of NGS and mass spectrometry for high throughput genomic and proteomic characterization of biological specimens.

"Sleep classification occupies an important role in medical sleep disorder research, basic neuroscience research, and industrial and transportation safety. Rats are the most frequently used species in animal sleep studies. Classification of rodent sleep and wakefulness using electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) recordings has traditionally been a time intensive manual task.To test the method, separate 24 hour EEG/EMG recordings from 10 adult male Sprague Dawley rats were scored by four human raters: two using traditional epoch by epoch manual scoring and two using the new PCA space scoring. The rats were implanted with stainless steel screws over the frontal and parietal cortices for EEG recordings and with wire electrodes in the neck muscles for EMG recordings. Rats were kept on a 12:12 hour light dark cycle.In summary, the PCA space method is a novel way to quickly classify sleep and wakefulness in rat recordings. It provides accuracy that is comparable to or better than inter rater agreement, while requiring less time than traditional epoch by epoch scoring.

The characteristic voltammetric stripping patterns of the dissolved QD barcodes correlate well with the predetermined metal ion concentration ratios used for the QD barcodes preparation.",PMC2836120.json,"reproducible electrochemically encoded quantum dot (qd) barcodes were prepared by using the reverse micelle synthetic approach. the encoding elements, zn2+, cd2+, pb2+ were confined within a single qd, which eliminates the cumbersome encapsulation process used by other common nanoparticle based barcode preparation schemes. the distinct voltammetric stripping patterns of zn2+, cd2+, pb2+ at distinguishable potentials with controllable current intensities offer excellent encoding capability for the prepared electrochemical (ec) qds. additionally, the simultaneous modification of the qd barcode surface with organic ligands during the preparation process make them potentially useful in biomedical research. for proof of concept of their application in bioassays, the ec qd barcodes were further employed as tags for an immunoassay of a cancer marker, carcinoembryonic antigen (cea). the voltammetric stripping response of the dissolved bardcode tags was proportional to log[cea] in the range from 0.01 ng ml1 to ng ml1, with a detection limit of 3.3 pg ml1. the synthesized ec qd barcodes hold considerable potentials in biodetection, encrypted information and product tracking.",0.37468354430379747,0.13231552162849874,0.20825386013666689
"Despite substantial reductions in diarrhea mortality over recent decades, diarrhea and its reciprocal relationship to undernutrition remain leading causes of global disability adjusted life years (DALYs). Diarrhea causes 1 to 2.5 billion illnesses and 1.5 to 2.5 million deaths per year in children under the age of 5 in developing countries. Furthermore, heavy burdens of diarrhea and undernutrition in early childhood profoundly impair growth and development.Detailed methods and materials for stool collection and examination have been described elsewhere. Briefly, specimen cups were distributed to homes of children with diarrhea and caretakers were instructed to collect the first stool the following day. To provide controls, specimens were also obtained every 3 months from children who had no diarrhea for at least 14 days.In this decade long cohort study of children followed from birth in an urban Brazilian shantytown, we found that ProD accounts for significant morbidity and is associated with early weaning, low maternal schooling, and undernutrition. Furthermore, we showed that ProD in infancy is a strong indicator of children's future risk of PD. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine ProD as a distinct class of diarrhea, thus our findings have several important public health implications that merit further consideration .",PMC2949449.json,"background & aims prolonged episodes of acute diarrhea (prod, duration days) or persistent diarrhea (pd, duration days) are important causes of undernutrition, yet the epidemiology and nutritional impact of prod are poorly understood. methods we conducted a 10 year cohort study of children from a brazilian shantytown who were followed from birth; data were collected on diarrhea, enteric pathogens, and anthropometry. results during 1,276 child years of observation, we recorded 3,257 diarrheal episodes. prod was twice as common as pd (12% and 5% of episodes, respectively); prod and pd together accounted for 50% of all days with diarrhea. prod was more common in infants whose mothers had not completed primary school (relative risk [rr]=2.1; 95% confidence interval=1.022.78). early weaning was associated with earlier onset of prod (spearman's , 0.309; p=0.005). infants with prod were twice as likely to develop pd in later childhood (log rank p=0.002) compared to infants with only acute diarrhea (ad, duration <7 days), even after controlling for confounders. children's growth was more severely stunted before their first episode of prod, compared with ad (mean height for age z score (haz) 0.81 vs. 0.51, p<0.05, unpaired t test). following prod, haz (haz= 0.232) and weight for age (waz= 0.26) significantly decreased (p<0.005 in paired t tests). prod was associated with cryptosporidium and shigella infections. conclusions prod accounts for significant morbidity and identifies children at risk of a vicious cycle of diarrhea and malnutrition. further studies are needed to address the recognition and control of prod and its consequences in resource limited settings and assess its role in pd pathogenesis.",0.3991853360488799,0.081799591002045,0.21156657826779787

"It has been well established that the androgen receptor gene (AR) plays an important role in molecular signaling and regulation and the subsequent cellular growth of prostate cancer. Testosterone is converted by 5  reductase to dihydrotestosterone, which binds to and activates the AR protein in the cytoplasm before the complex translocates into the nucleus. Once inside the nucleus, the activated AR protein recruits a host of transcriptional cofactors to aid in the expression of AR target genes.Genomic DNA was obtained for each of the 10 cell lines studied. Genomic DNA was purchased for the following cell lines from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA): DU 145, LnCAP, MDA PCa 2b, PC 3, RWPE 1, RWPE 2, PZ HPV 7 and 22Rv1. For DU 145, LnCAP, PC 3, PC 3M, and CWR 22, gDNA was extracted from established cell lines within our laboratory using the Qiagen Midi Blood Kit per manufacturers protocol.As shown in , our analysis confirmed the presence of the homozygous L57Q SNP in the 22RV1 cell line and the homozygous H874Y SNP in the 22RV1 and CWR22 cell lines, as previously stated by Chlenski et al. In addition, we confirmed the homozygous L701H SNP in MDA PCa 2b cells and the homozygous T877A SNP in the LnCAP and MDA PCa 2b cell lines.

"Imagine standing on a busy city street corner. The auditory scene is dynamically changing from 1 min to the next as cars, buses, car horns and voices pass and enter your space. These concurrent sound sources contribute to the acoustic signal that enters the ears.Three sinusoidal tones of 50 ms duration (5 ms rise/fall times) were created with Neuroscan STIM software (Compumedics, El Paso, TX, USA) and presented binaurally through insert earphones (E a rtone 3A, Aearo, IN, USA). There was one test sequence and two priming sequences. For the test sequence, two tones were presented in a fixed pattern (XOOOXOOOXOOO), where X represents a tone of 1046 Hz and O represents a tone of 1397 Hz [a 5 semitone (ST) frequency difference (f) between them].The results of this study demonstrate that neurophysiological indices of deviance detection accommodate to the dynamically changing acoustic environment. When presented with ambiguous sound input, previous sounds influence the organization of new sounds, maintaining the organization that was current. Even though the immediate environment of the probe tones was the same in all of the test blocks, the prime tones modulated the response to the probe tones within the test blocks toward integration or segregation.",PMC2649007.json,"the auditory scene is dynamic, changing from min to the next as sound sources enter and leave our space. how does the brain resolve the problem of maintaining neural representations of the distinct yet changing sound sources? we used an auditory streaming paradigm to test the dynamics of multiple sound source representation, when switching between integrated and segregated sound streams. the mismatch negativity (mmn) component of event related potentials was used as index of change detection to observe stimulus driven modulation of the ongoing sound organization. probe tones were presented randomly within ambiguously organized sound sequences to reveal whether the neurophysiological representation of the sounds was integrated (no mmn) or segregated (mmn). the pattern of results demonstrated context dependent responses to a single tone that was modulated in dynamic fashion as the auditory environment rapidly changed from integrated to segregated sounds. this suggests a rapid form of auditory plasticity in which the longer term sound context influences the current state of neural activity when it is ambiguous. these results demonstrate stimulus driven modulation of neural activity that accommodates to the dynamically changing acoustic environment.",0.47028423772609823,0.14025974025974025,0.30755312601736057
"Selective inhibitors of the inducible isoform of cyclooxygenase (COX 2) were developed to provide relief of pain associated with arthritis, surgery, and other conditions, while lowering the incidence of gastrointestinal complications compared to non selective, non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs (nsNSAIDs). However, selective COX 2 inhibitors have been purported to increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction, and mortality. One widely prescribed selective COX 2 inhibitor, rofecoxib, was removed from the market in 2004 due to an increased incidence of adverse cardiovascular events observed during the VIGOR trial which examined the effects of rofecoxib on arthritic pain relief.In all cases total LCx occlusion was observed during the final coronary angiogram, and there was no difference in observed Rentrop scores (control 0.890.3, NAP 1.40.38, and CBX 1.60.37, p=0.35).

"Identifying methamphetamine (MAMP) exposed neonates is critical to ascertain potential maternal and neonatal toxicities, to develop prevention strategies, and to establish medical and social interventions for children and their mothers. In communities with high MAMP use, over 5% of pregnant women reported using the drug at some point during pregnancy. To date, few studies have investigated human maternal MAMP use on neonatal outcomes, and the effect of MAMP on the developing fetus is unclear.All meconium specimens were analyzed using a validated LC/MS/MS method for the identification of ten AMP related compounds.

"According to role incompatibility theory, individuals adjust behaviors across the lifespan as they adopt new roles that may be incompatible with these behaviors . For example, alcohol use decreases after marriage (; ; ). The transition to parenthood appears to be particularly salient for reduction of alcohol use, especially for women .Data from three prenatal cohorts from Magee Womens Hospital were merged for integrative data analysis, ensuring adequate power for the proposed analyses . These data were collected for three studies designed to examine the long term effects of exposure to prenatal substance use, two with adult mothers (AA06390, DA03874: PI N. Day) and one with teen mothers (AA08284, DA09275: PI M. Cornelius). The adult mothers were 1842 years old and the teen mothers were 1218 years old at the first wave of assessment.According to role incompatibility theory, the onset of motherhood is associated with a decreased likelihood of risky drinking, but prior studies on alcohol use in mothers reveal substantial heterogeneity in their drinking patterns. This study addresses a gap in that literature by focusing on the effect of age at transition to motherhood on patterns of risky alcohol use over 17 years. The main finding of this study was that younger mothers were more likely to be classified in a risky drinking trajectory compared to older mothers, after considering the effects of the proposed covariates .",PMC5678932.json,"background no prospective study of maternal alcohol use has focused on age at transition to motherhood as a predictor of trajectories of risky drinking. the goal of this study was to examine the impact of maternal age at first birth on trajectories of alcohol use beyond recommended levels over a 17 year span. methods pregnant women (n = 456) were recruited at an urban prenatal clinic. the women (1342 years old; 64% african american, 36% white) were interviewed about alcohol use during pregnancy and at 6, 10, 14, and years postpartum. growth mixture modeling (gmm) was used to identify trajectories of risky drinking. maternal age at first birth was then regressed onto trajectory class membership. results the gmm on maternal alcohol use identified groups of mothers as a function of alcohol use before, during and after the pregnancy. the majority of mothers (66%) were identified as having low risk trajectories of alcohol use over the 17 year span. however, two groups were in the higher risk categories, with 23% identified as being in a long term high risk trajectory, and 11% in a short term high risk trajectory group. maternal age at first birth predicted membership in a high risk group: younger mothers were more likely to be classified into a long term high risk alcohol use group. conclusions younger mothers were more likely to engage in risky drinking early in pregnancy, continuing to years postpartum. these results can help physicians target mothers who are likely to exceed current niaaa guidelines of abstinence during pregnancy, and no more than drinks per week in the postpartum.",0.4065708418891171,0.1319587628865979,0.27191936930706545
"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most commonly inherited hemoglobinopathy in the United States, and 1 in every 500 African Americans is born with homozygous SCD, the most common form of the disease . It is estimated that sickle cell anemia affects more than 70,000 Americans . Because predominant hemoglobin S (HbS) red cells block blood vessels due to their reduced pliability and increased adhesiveness, patients with SCD have a hospitalization rate 7 to 30 times higher than persons aged less than 60 years and are more likely to undergo surgical procedures to treat persistent or acute organ dysfunction [].Outcomes of Inpatients With and Without Sickle Cell Disease After High Volume Surgical Procedures 19787790 Our study has some limitations.

"Declarative memory depends on the medial temporal lobe (MTL), which includes the hippocampus, the dentate gyrus, the subicular complex, together with the adjacent perirhinal, entorhinal, and parahippocampal cortices . One of the most widely studied examples of declarative memory is recognition, the ability to judge that an item has been encountered previously. Recognition is generally considered to consist of two components, recollection and familiarity .We first identified regions of MTL where activity varied during learning as a function of subsequent item memory strength. Accordingly, we conducted a linear trend analysis using item confidence ratings 1 through 6, respectively, and collapsing across all levels of source confidence. This procedure resulted in 18.45.9, 34.89.2, 52.05.9, 48.66.1, 62.88.4 and 13814.7 trials in memory strength conditions 1 through 6, respectively.Participants studied 360 words in the scanner and then took a recognition memory test in which they first made an old/new judgment and then, for words declared old, made a source memory judgment about the condition under which the word had been presented.

"Good premorbid functioning in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders is associated with better clinical and functional outcomes in both first episode (; ; ; ; ) and chronically ill patients . However, mortality studies have suggested that among persons with schizophrenia, good premorbid functioning increases the risk of completed suicide . This is possibly because of the demoralization syndrome in which those with good premorbid functioning and insight into their illness consider the differences between their premorbid capacities and expectations on the one hand, and their current difficulties in functioning and lower than expected achievements on the other hand.Is Poor Premorbid Functioning a Risk Factor for Suicide Attempts in First Admission Psychosis? 19954930 Suicide attempt was defined as an act of potentially self injurious behavior inflicted with at least some intent to die. Lifetime suicide attempts were determined from multiple sources, including the depression module of the Schedule for Clinical Diagnosis III R version (SCID) supplemented by questions assessing severity of suicide ideation and attempts, the suicide item in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale , and the reason for admission recorded in the medical record.In summary, the current epidemiologically based findings suggest that persons suffering from psychotic illness who had poor premorbid functioning are a very vulnerable group for suicide attempts. Taken together, it is suggested that persons with histories of suicide attempts and poor functioning prior to onset of illness should be carefully monitored for future suicide attempts, as they are 5.6 times more likely than those with good premorbid functioning and no previous attempts to have subsequent attempts . The results of the current study have several implications for practice.",PMC2818578.json,"background while poor premorbid functioning is associated with poorer outcomes in psychotic illnesses, little is known about whether it is also a risk factor for suicide attempts. objective the current study examined the association of premorbid functioning and suicide attempts in a county wide cohort of first admission inpatients. method data were derived from participants of the suffolk county mental health project (n=444) over the course of month follow up. premorbid functioning was estimated and categorized (good vs. poor/declining) using the premorbid adjustment scale (pas). results poorer premorbid functioning was significantly associated with increased likelihood of a suicide attempt prior to first psychiatric hospital admission. specifically, 33.0% of participants with poor/declining premorbid functioning had a history of suicide attempts compared to 23.5% with good premorbid functioning. among participants with a prior attempt (n=126), poor premorbid functioning was significantly associated with an increased likelihood of additional attempts during the four years after first hospitalization. conclusion identifying those with poor premorbid functioning and prior histories of attempts could help clinicians target high risk patients. thus, greater attention to persons with both risk factors may form the basis for early interventions aimed towards reducing the risk for subsequent suicide attempts.",0.4349680170575693,0.158458244111349,0.2853844952197042

Understanding the course of binge eating and factors associated with its maintenance could assist with treatment planning and intervention development .The course of binge eating from adolescence to young adulthood Participants were involved in Project EAT (Eating Among Teens and Young Adults), a 10 year longitudinal study of eating, weight and psychosocial factors among young people . Data were collected during middle/late adolescence [Time 1 (T1)] and at 5 and 10 year follow up [Time 2 (T2): late adolescence/early young adulthood; Time 3 (T3): early/middle young adulthood]. All study protocols were approved by University of Minnesota's Institutional Review Board .This investigation found that binge eating was relatively stable from late adolescence/early young adulthood to early/middle young adulthood but less so during the transition from middle/late adolescence to late adolescence/early young adulthood. Improved body satisfaction, depression symptoms, and self esteem all predicted binge eating cessation during the former time span (although it is also possible that remitted binge eating led to changes in these factors over time), while worsening symptoms predicted new onset binge eating in young adulthood. Overall, results suggest that improved psychosocial functioning may be associated with better binge eating outcomes during the transition from adolescence to young adulthood .",PMC3843976.json,"objective the course of binge eating in adolescence is variable and little is known about factors maintaining binge eating behaviors. the current study sought to characterize the course of binge eating and identify psychosocial factors associated with its maintenance. methods a population based sample reported on binge eating, depression symptoms, self esteem, and body satisfaction at 5 year intervals spanning early/middle adolescence [time (t1)], late adolescence/early young adulthood [time (t2)] and early/middle young adulthood [time (t3)]. logistic regression examined factors predicting maintenance or cessation of binge eating. results a total of 15.8% of participants with binge eating at t1 continued to report binge eating at t2, and 42.0% of participants with binge eating at t2 continued to report binge eating at t3. from t1 to t2, improvements in self esteem predicted cessation of binge eating. from t2 to t3, cessation of binge eating was predicted by improved body satisfaction, greater decreases in depression symptoms, and greater improvements in self esteem. conclusions binge eating is relatively stable from late adolescence/early young adulthood to early/middle young adulthood, but less so from middle/late adolescence to late adolescence/early young adulthood. improvements in psychosocial functioning during this timeframe may improve the outcome of binge eating, although mechanisms responsible for psychosocial changes (e.g., treatment involvement) require further investigation. self esteem appears to be a particularly salient factor involved in binge eating cessation and should be targeted in prevention and treatment programs.",0.6196078431372548,0.3070866141732284,0.3845921634499858
"The sequelae of cardiovascular disease are amongst the leading causes of death and disability in the developed world. Thus, much research has been undertaken in order to prevent and treat the resulting cardiovascular syndromes. One greatly enabling technology that has arisen over the past decade is nanomedicine.MI brings about a massive inflammatory response characterized by the recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages to the damaged myocardium. This response is sequential and results in the healing of the infarct. Recruited leukocytes secrete a number of proteinases, such as matrix metalloproteinases, and proteases, such as cathepsin B, in order to facilitate the clearing away of necrotic debris.Nanomedicine allows for the creation of agents specifically designed to enhance the diagnosis and treatment of disease.

"The ease with which synthetic genes that encode protein based biopolymers can be assembled has greatly improved over the past decade, due to advances in molecular biology for the synthesis and assembly of genes that encode multiple repeats of peptide monomers. These advances have been driven by the utility of these biopolymers for a variety of applications including biomaterials , , tissue engineering scaffolds , , as materials for surface modification and as drug delivery vehicles . The driving force for the use of artificial repetitive polypeptides in these applications stems from the ability of genetically encoded synthesis to control the polypeptide sequence, architecture, molecular weight (MW), and polydispersity, with a precision that is, as yet, unmatched by chemical polymerization .1.5 g of the pET 24a(+) vector was digested with 20 U of XbaI and 20 U of BamHI in NEB buffer 3 for 4 h at 37 C.

The linearized vector was eluted in 30 L of distilled, deionized water.This paper presents a straightforward and general method to rapidly produce a repetitive polypeptide of any desired sequence and length over a wide range of molecular weights. The key to this approach is to use type IIs restriction enzymes to produce seamless, head to tail repeats of any arbitrary DNA sequence by a process that requires reconstitution of the plasmid in every oligomerization step.

IOP is the level of pressure in the eye at which the aqueous humor producedin the ciliary body and flowing into the posterior chamber of the eye is balanced bythe aqueous humor leaving the eye through the conventional outflow pathway(trabecular meshwork, Schlemms canal, aqueous veins and collector channels)and unconventional outflow pathway (the uveoscleral and uveovortex pathways).Large, population based studies suggest that lower ocular blood flow andperfusion pressure are associated with glaucoma prevalence and is a risk factorfor the incident development of glaucoma and progression of thedisease, .

DNA encoding the mature human mitochondrial superoxide dismutase polypeptide (lacking the mitochondrial targeting sequence) was amplified from a cDNA clone (pHMNSOD 4) obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), using primers HSOD 1 (5 GCACATATGAAGCACAGCACAGCCTCCCCGACCTGC 3) and HSOD 2 (5 GCAAAGCTTACTTTTTGCAAGCCATGTATCTTTCAGTTACATTCTCCC 3) designed based on the cDNA sequence.Metal delivery is an essential step in the functional maturation of every metalloenzyme that, for most proteins, is just beginning to be investigated . In principle, metal binding in vivo may occur at any point during protein biosynthesis, from the nascent polypeptide emerging from the ribosome to the fully folded, assembled apoprotein, complicating analysis of the biological metallation processes. In vitro studies on metal binding by the isolated apoprotein, on the other hand, can provide insight into the role of protein structural features in forming the metal complex and may be investigated over a relatively wide range of well defined experimental conditions .",PMC2783852.json,"metal uptake by the antioxidant defense metalloenzyme manganese superoxide dismutase (mnsod) is an essential step in the functional maturation of the protein that is just beginning to be investigated in detail. we have extended earlier in vitro studies on metal binding by the dimeric escherichia coli apo mnsod to investigate the mechanism of metal uptake by tetrameric human and thermus thermophilus apo mnsods. like the e. coli apo mnsod, these proteins also bind metal ions in vitro in a thermally activated, ph sensitive process. however, metal uptake by the tetrameric apo mnsods exhibits a number of important differences. in particular, there is no indication of conformational gating requirement for metal binding for these proteins, and the reaction is first order in metal ion. the high concentration of metal ion that is required to achieve physiologically relevant metallation rates for tetrameric human apo mnsod in vitro suggests the possibility that co translational metal binding or chaperone interactions may be required in vivo.",0.398034398034398,0.1481481481481481,0.27463117301627576
"Studies into the role of phospholipase D (PLD) in the regulation of vesicle transport and protein trafficking were provoked by the observation that ADP ribosylation factor (ARF) proteins are efficacious activators of PLD []. ARF proteins have been previously implicated as factors for regulation of intracellular vesicle trafficking and are found on the Golgi apparatus and the plasma membrane . The PLD discussed in this review hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine (PC) to yield phosphatidic acid (PA) and choline.Phospholipase D in the Golgi Apparatus 19376267 PLD1 can be activated by all members of the ARF family in their GTP bound states, and the potency of this effect is enhanced by myristoylation of ARF . However, although the effects are likely to be direct because they can be readily observed using purified proteins, the mechanism whereby ARF stimulates enzyme activity and a site of direct interaction on PLD1 remain to be identified. ARF1 5 localize to the perinuclear region and the Golgi apparatus, and combinatorial RNAi mediated knock down revealed that when ARF1 was depleted together with ARF3, ARF4 or ARF5, the distribution of the COPI coat protein  cop was disrupted .Recent advances have provided insight as to how PLD is involved in regulating structure and function of the Golgi apparatus .

As physicians and patients co manage chronic conditions and implement care plans, an expanded concept of patient autonomy that includes both decisional and executive autonomy is required.

"Since the publication of the Institute of Medicines report Bridging the gap between practice and research: Forging partnerships with community based drug and alcohol treatment , there has been growing interest in the transfer of evidence based treatment technologies into community based treatment organizations. The National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) is a large scale federal initiative focused on the research to practice gap. The CTN has brought together university based researchers and clinicians from community based treatment programs (CTPs) for the two goals of conducting multisite clinical trials of treatment interventions in real world treatment programs and encouraging the adoption of evidence based treatment techniques in these settings . A significant focus of the CTNs research agenda has been the use of buprenorphine (Suboxone; Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals) for treating opioid dependence in different types of treatment settings and patient populations.Adoption of buprenorphine was defined as current use of this medication by the CTP. This dichotomous variable (1 = adoption, 0 = non adoption) was measured at baseline and at the 24 month follow up interview. Based on these two waves of data, CTPs were also sorted into four categories at the 24 month follow up interview: early adoption (used buprenorphine at baseline and continued to use at follow up), later adoption (nonadopters at baseline, but adoption by the follow up), nonadoption (did not use buprenorphine at either time point), and discontinuation (used buprenorphine at baseline, but no longer used at the follow up) .Although there are a growing number of studies about the adoption of buprenorphine, this is the first study to examine the pattern of adoption, discontinuation, and sustainability of this pharmacotherapy over a 2 year period.

"Simple monogenic diseases (Mendelian disorders) are particularly amenable to determining the underlying etiology because of the reliable way that they are inherited in families. Hence, employing linkage studies (and other methods), and exploiting the fruits of the Human Genome Project, the primary defect has been identified in more than 2500 such disorders. In contrast to complex genetic diseases (such as diabetes) the single gene in a Mendelian disorder, such as autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), determines if the individual develops the disease.Determinants of Renal Disease Variability in ADPKD 20219616 Although genetic and allelic effects can explain some of the phenotypic variability in ADPKD, it is likely that genetic factors elsewhere in the genome also play a significant role. There have been suggestions that intrafamilial variability may be suggestive of anticipation; disease getting successively more severe with each generation (usually associated with expanding trinucleotide repeats). However, subsequent studies have highlighted the degree of intrafamilial variability but not found a trend for more severe disease in offspring, or for trinucleotide repeat expansion.Whether a patient develops ADPKD is simply due to if they have a pathogenic mutation in the PKD1 or PKD2 gene, however, the severity of disease behaves more like a complex trait. The gene involved is a major determinant of disease severity but increasingly allelic effects appear important, especially for atypical disease presentations.

The Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the American College of Sports Medicine recommend that older adults with no limiting physical health condition(s) engage in at least 150 min of moderate physical activity and/or muscle strengthening activities per week . However, the majority of persons in the United States do not engage in regular physical activity that is consistent with this recommendation.Two binary outcome measures (regular moderate/vigorous physical activity, and regular light physical activity) were constructed based on a series of questions about physical activity/exercise participation. Respondents were asked how often they participated in vigorous exercise, moderate exercise, and mild activity. Vigorous exercise consisted of sports or activities that are vigorous, such as running or jogging, swimming, cycling, aerobics or gym workout, tennis, or digging with a spade or shovel. Moderate activity included sports or activities that are moderately energetic such as gardening, cleaning the car, walking at a moderate pace, dancing, floor, or stretching exercises. Mild activity was described as sports or activities that are mildly energetic such as vacuuming, laundry, and home repairs. Five possible responses were available: every day, more than once a week, once a week, one to two times a month, or hardly ever or never. While others have combined these measures of different levels of physical activity into one index, we evaluated light and moderate/vigorous separately in order to assess potential differences in the role of pain has on light physical activity versus moderate/vigorous physical activity.The public health impact of inadequate levels of physical activity among older adults is significant, given the substantial increase expected in the percentage of racial and ethnic minority older adults that is estimated to occur over the next 40 years . With the increase in the racially and ethnically diverse population we need to gain a better understanding of the plausible explanations for the discrepancies in self reported levels of physical activity among older adults.

Approximately 6590% of injection drug users (IDU) in the US, western Europe, and Australia were HCV antibody positive in the 1980s and early 1990s (reviewed in ).We sought to estimate three unknown quantities: (1) the per event transmission probability due to RNS in the acute phase (denoted A,RNS), which was set equal to 10 times the probabilities in the chronic and attenuated acute phases (denoted C,RNS and AA,RNS respectively), (2) the per event transmission probability due to AES in the acute phase (denoted A,AES), set equal to 10 times the probabilities in the chronic and attenuated acute phases (denoted C,AES and AA,AES respectively), and (3) the per day probability of AES events in the low risk group.

"Abnormal behavioral inhibition, e.g., the expression of impulsive or compulsive characteristics, is a defining symptom of many psychiatric and neurodegenerative conditions, including attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Parkinsons disease, schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder, pathological gambling and addiction (; ; ; ; ). These deficits arise from dysregulation within frontal/basal gangia circuitry that is often linked with dopamine dysfunction . For example, reduced dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) expression correlates with poor behavioral control across species (; ; ; ), and decreased striatal dopamine D2/D3 receptor availability is linked to methamphetamine and cocaine addiction (human: ; rat: ) .Before surgery, rats were tested with one set of stop signal delays (SSDs) to generate inhibition functions and calculate SSRT. This ensured that the rats were performing the stop signal task correctly, to conform with the constraints of the race model . Rats first completed three no delay sessions to calculate mean GoRT for each individual.We showed that stopping is directly modulated by dopamine in the striatum, but that this action is dopamine receptor specific and anatomically constrained. Dopamine D1 and D2 receptors in the dorsomedial striatum, but not nucleus accumbens core, had clearly opposing functions to control the speed with which an action was stopped (SSRT).

"Enterobacter sakazakii (ES) is a member of the Enterobacteriaceae family that was described as a new species in 1980.

"Bone remodeling is the primary processes for modifying bone mass in adults. Bone remodeling is therefore a key process in the development and treatment of osteoporosis and other metabolic bone diseases. Bone remodeling occurs at discrete locations on the bone surface and consists of a group of osteoclasts that remove a patch of bone, followed in time by a group of osteoblasts that form bone at the same location.Three Dimensional Surface Texture Visualization of Bone Tissue Through Epifluorescence Based Serial Block Face Imaging 19772536 Serial block face imaging using epifluorescence is implemented using a serial milling device as described by Kazakia and colleagues . We refer the reader to the original publication for a thorough description of the image acquisition device and comparison to other available approaches. We only briefly describe the technique here.High resolution images processed with the techniques described in the current study showed much smoother bone surfaces than those processed with previous techniques (). Surface irregularities characteristic of osteoclast activity are readily visible in the grayscale and segmented images at 0.7 m resolution () and are not visible in lower resolution images or images processed using previous techniques.

"Much research finds lower income students lag behind their higher income peers in cognitive and social emotional skills by school entry. These initial poverty related gaps in student skills increase as children age and may have increased over the last several decades (e.g., ; ).

"The ability to visualize cells using differential labelling techniques has had a central role in biology since the beginning of the 20th century. The classic example is the Golgi stain, developed by Camillo Golgi, and elevated to an art form by Ramon y Cajal. Labels, such as the Golgi stain, however, which enable us to visualize the intricate structural details of individual cells, are time consuming and can only be used on post mortem tissue, thereby limiting their value for many physiological studies.Diolistics: incorporating fluorescent dyes into biological samples using a gene gun 17945370 One of the potentially most useful applications of this technique is in the transportation of optical nanosensors. A nanosensor is a device that is less than 1000 nm in diameter and that can sense and report a chemical or biological event. Nanosensors are therefore ideal for monitoring events within tissues or cells or even within some intercellular organelles because they can be located close to the site of action yet cause minimal physical perturbation.Diolistics has many advantages compared with other techniques of incorporating dyes into cells and we envisage that it will have a major role in improving our understanding of the structure and function of cells and parts of cells that have proved difficult to study previously. The modifications to the Helios gene gun have shown that lipophilic dyes can penetrate up to 500 m providing the potential to study areas deep within tissues. The development of the capillary type gene gun has shown that it is possible to target the microprojectiles to very discrete areas (e.g. ) enabling, for example, the monitoring of ion or pH changes in individual cells.",PMC2649371.json,"the hand held gene gun provides a rapid and efficient method of incorporating fluorescent dyes into cells, a technique that is becoming known as diolistics. transporting fluorescent dyes into cells has, in the past, used predominantly injection or chemical methods. the use of the gene gun, combined with the new generation of fluorescent dyes, circumvents some of the problems of using these methods and also enables the study of cells that have proved difficult traditionally to transfect (e.g. those deep in tissues and/or terminally differentiated); in addition, the use of ion or metabolite sensitive dyes provides a route to study cellular mechanisms. diolistics is also ideal for loading cells with optical nanosensors nanometre sized sensors linked to fluorescent probes. here, we discuss the theoretical considerations of using diolistics, the advantages compared with other methods of inserting dyes into cells and the current uses of the technique, with particular consideration of nanosensors.",0.44083526682134566,0.13053613053613053,0.2523703721060404

"Despite recent advances in acute stroke treatment and post stroke rehabilitation, many stroke survivors suffer long lasting impairment. The typical stroke patient slowly regains partial function during the first months after stroke. This recovery depends on factors such as lesion size and location, but the neuronal underpinnings of successful stroke recovery remain poorly understood .Consistent with previous studies, we found a significant improvement in motor performance in patients after two weeks of CIMT. In parallel with this improvement in function we observed a tendency for GABA to increase. However, no significant difference could be observed after correcting for the GM fraction within the voxel, suggesting that this increase may be driven by a generalized increase in neuronal activity within the trained motor cortex, rather than a specific change in GABAergic activity.One patient did not complete the 2 week training and follow up scan because of an unrelated infection.

There is also uncertainty in our preexisting knowledge of that event  this is known as prior uncertainty.We wanted to ask how the brain computes prior versus likelihood information online in order to arrive at a sensorimotor decision. For that decision, at each trial the subject needs to decide how much to weigh the likelihood relative to the prior. If subjects behave as predicted by Bayesian statistics, then this slope can be estimated for each trial (see Experimental Procedures and for details).In this study we tested where prior and likelihood uncertainty are represented in the brain.

At the time, many scholars were excited that quantitative formal models of choice behaviorfrom economics, evolutionary biology, computer science, and mathematical psychologywere beginning to provide a fruitful framework for new and more detailed investigations of the neural mechanisms of choice. To borrow famous typology for computational studies of the brain, decision scholars seemed for the first time poised to investigate decision making at the theoretical, algorithmic, and implementation levels simultaneously .The Neurobiology of Decision: Consensus and Controversy 19778504  Any neural model of decision making needs to answer two key questions. First, how are the subjective values of the various options under consideration learned, stored, and represented? Second, how is a single highly valued action chosen from amongst the options under consideration to be implemented by the motor circuitry?Neurophysiological investigations over the last seven years have begun to solidify the basic outlines of a neural mechanism for choice. This breakneck pace of discovery makes us optimistic that the field will soon be able to resolve many of the current controversies, and that it will also expand to address some of the questions that are now completely open .

"Marijuana is the most widely used illicit drug among adolescents . Marijuana dependence develops in approximately 1417% of adolescents who ever use it (Anthony, 2006; Hall & Degenhardt, 2007), and may lead to an increased risk of other illegal drug use and depressive symptoms (Hall & Degenhardt, 2007). Understanding of the factors influencing adolescents substance use may aid in the prevention of harmful use patterns.marijuanaadolescent substance abusesocial normssocial learning theory Based on previous literature, we proposed that social norms would have direct effects on negative marijuana outcomes and indirect effects through self efficacy. Moreover, we expected that associating with heavier using friends (descriptive norms) and perceiving friends as more approving of marijuana use (injunctive norms) would be associated with lower confidence in the ability to resist the temptation to smoke marijuana (self efficacy), which would in turn be associated with more frequent use and greater symptoms of abuse and dependence. The SEM model included latent variables for injunctive norms and marijuana outcomes and measured variables for descriptive norms and self efficacy.Overall support for study hypotheses was mixed.

"Synchronization of local alpha rhythms has been associated with cortical idling and inhibition of processing, whereas engagement of a cortical region typically yields local alpha desynchronization (see ; for reviews). Tasks such as the retention of visual information in short term memory (STM) and working memory entail paradoxical predictions about local alpha synchronization in visual cortex as (1) active processing in visual cortex is required for retention, suggesting local alpha desynchronization, and (2) successful retention of a memory trace may require inhibition of potentially disruptive incoming visual information, suggesting local alpha synchronization similar to that which is observed when attention is allocated away from the visual modality (; ; ) or away from one visual hemifield (; ; ). Accordingly, increased engagement of STM and working memory has been associated with local alpha band synchronization (; ; ; ), desynchronization or both synchronization and desynchronization .Subjects lay supine and viewed stimuli projected onto a screen above them (40 cm from nasion).

"Aging parents of adults with serious mental illness (SMI) are often called upon to provide long term or even life long assistance to their disabled children, because of the chronic and episodic nature of SMI. This comes at a stage in life when most other aging parents can look forward to their adult children achieving self sufficiency and independence. These issues are often further complicated by shortages of formal services and residential options for persons with SMI (; ; ).An adapted version of the assistance in daily living module of the Family Burden Interview Schedule  Short Form was used to measure the types and amount of assistance participants provided to their adult SMI children during the previous month. This 8 item scale asks respondents to provide information about their provision of assistance with the following daily living activities: dressing and personal hygiene, housework, meal preparation, shopping, transportation, financial management, medication management, and time management . A wait list control (delayed treatment) experimental design was used to examine the impact of the brief problem solving intervention on the life satisfaction and emotional well being of the aging parental caregivers in the study.In our current economic climate, most community based human service agencies are faced with a continuous struggle to obtain the resources needed to provide an adequate level of formal care and services to persons with serious and chronic mental health problems. As the service and therapeutic needs of this population continue into the future, the importance of family members as the providers of assistance to persons with SMI will increase due, in part, to the increasing budgetary pressures most human service agencies are likely to experience .

"Extensive data amassed over decades documents the economic, occupational, social, and health benefits of attaining a high school diploma (for reviews see ; ). High school graduates earn a national average of $8,000 more annually, relative to high school dropouts, and are far less likely to be periodically unemployed, on government assistance, or in prison. In addition, dropouts age 25 and older report being in worse health than adults of similar age who are not dropouts, regardless of income .The current study extends prior studies by estimating the effect of retention in grades 15 on high school completion status (i.e., high school diploma, GED, or drop out) 14 years after students entered first grade. Specifically, we assessed the effect of retention in grades 15 on high school completion status, using a prospective, longitudinal research design involving an ethnically diverse sample of students entering first grade in one of three Texas school districts in the Fall of 2001 or 2002. The school composition of the districts from which the students were drawn was demographically similar to the school population in Texas, and the mobility of students in the sample was typical to that of Texas schools.Using the logistic regression based propensity score weights, we also explored whether the effects of retention on school completion status were moderated by key demographic variables including ethnicity (Black, White, Hispanic), gender, the combination of gender and ethnicity, and parent highest education. For the high school graduation vs. drop out contrast, a retention x ethnicity interaction was found. Blacks showed a larger effect of retention than whites, dropping out rather than graduating from high school at a higher rate (for interaction contrast, z = 2.05, p = .041, odds ratio = 5.97).",PMC6377178.json,"this year prospective study investigated the effect of retention in grades on high school completion (diploma, ged, or drop out). participants were (52.7% males) ethnically diverse, academically at risk students recruited from texas schools into the study when they were in first grade (mean age = 6.57). propensity score weighting successfully equated the retained students and the students continuously promoted students on covariates assessed in grade 1. at the end of years, had earned a diploma, had obtained a ged, had dropped out, and were missing school completion status. using multinomial logistic regression with high school graduation as the reference outcome, retention led to a significant increase in the likelihood of dropping out of high school (odds ratio = 2.61), above students propensity to be retained and additional covariates. the contrast between graduation and ged outcomes was not significant. a significant retention x ethnicity x gender interaction was obtained: the negative effect of retention was strongest for african american and hispanic girls. even though grade retention in the elementary grades does not harm students in terms of their academic achievement or educational motivation at the transition to high school, retention increases the odds that a student will drop out of school before obtaining a high school diploma.",0.5060728744939271,0.19105691056910568,0.2821654823166803

"The prognosis for hepatobiliary and pancreatic malignancies is dismal with 5 year survival ranging from 520%. Accurate detection, diagnosis, and staging may lead to more appropriate treatments and improved clinical outcomes. Since surgical resection is the primary curative option for most hepatobiliary/pancreatic cancers, earlier and more accurate detection may increase the likelihood of timely intervention.Ironically, the same reason that PET can discern tumor differentiation may also explain its poor overall rate of detecting primary HCC. Hexokinase and glucose 6 phosphatase is highly expressed in normal hepatocytes but in tumors may vary greatly depending on the degree of tumor differentiation. Consequently, tumors may not be readily distinguishable in the liver on the basis of glucose metabolism due to variable FDG uptake relative to normal liver tissue .The role of PET in detecting hepatobiliary and pancreatic malignancies has not yet been established. The current literature indicates that PET is not adequate in making the initial diagnosis of many primary hepatobiliary and pancreatic tumors.

Mental illness stigma remains a major burden for people with mental illnesses (; ; ), but there is widespread optimism that public understanding of the biogenetic aspects of psychopathology will alleviate this stigma by reducing the tendency to hold persons experiencing disorders responsible for their illness.

"For complex socioeconomic reasons, private health insurance, typically provided by an employer, is the dominant mechanism for paying for health services in the United States. (p According to the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured and the Urban Institute, analyses of data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) show that, in 2006, 54% of the US civilian, noninstitutionalized population had employer sponsored health insurance; 5% had private, non group health insurance; and 26% had public health insurance coverage. Approximately 46 million US residents (16% of the population) are currently uninsured.Health Care Coverage and the Health Care Industry 19834000 Several limitations of this study should be noted. First, our measure of uninsurance was a point in time measure representing individuals self reported lack of insurance coverage at the time of their interview.

"The Eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, has a reciprocal dopaminergic and serotonergic innervation of the lateral ciliated cells of gill epithelia, similar to that of Mytilus edulis . The innervation originates in the cerebral and visceral ganglia, and controls the gill via the branchial nerve. Excitation of the dopaminergic circuit results in a terminal release of dopamine at the level of the gill epithelium that slows down and stops the beating rates of the lateral cilia.Effects of p Aminosalicylic acid on the neurotoxicity of manganese on the dopaminergic innervation of the cilia of the lateral cells of the gill of the bivalve mollusc, Crassostrea virginica 19944778 The branchial nerve of isolated gill preparation and the CVC of VG preparations were stimulated with suction electrodes made from IV tubing and a 20 gauge stainless steel wire. The tips were heated and pulled to match the diameter of the branchial nerve or CVC. Bipolar repeating pulses of 2 ms duration at 10V and either 5 Hz (low frequency) or 20 Hz (high frequency) were applied to the nerves with a Grass S48 Stimulator for 10 min while cilia of the lateral ciliated epithelial cells were observed.Adding manganese chloride directly to isolated gill preparations as high as 1 mM, did not significantly alter basal beating rates of the lateral cilia . Stimulating the branchial nerve with suction electrodes produces a change in the beating rate of the lateral cilia that is dependent on the frequency of stimulation. Low frequency bipolar pulses (5 Hz, 10V, and 2 ms duration) for 10min accelerate the beating rate, while high frequency bipolar pulses (20 Hz, 10 V, and 2 ms duration) for 10 min decreased the beating rate .",PMC2794987.json,"the lateral cilia of the gill of crassostrea virginica are controlled by a dopaminergicserotonergic innervation. dopamine is the neurotransmitter causing cilio inhibition. high levels of manganese are neurotoxic to people, causing manganism, a parkinson like disease. clinical interventions for manganism have not been very successful. recently, p aminosalicylic acid (pas) was reported as an effective treatment of severe manganism in humans; however, its mechanism of action is unknown. previously, we reported that manganese treatments caused disruption of the dopaminergic innervation of gill of c. virginica. here we compared the effects of manganese on gill innervation in the presence of pas, edta or acetylsalicylic acid (asa), and examined whether co treating animals with pas could block the deleterious effects of manganese on the oyster's dopaminergic innervation of the gill. beating rates of the lateral cilia of the gill were measured by stroboscopic microscopy. pre treating gill preparations with pas or edta blocked the neurotoxic effects of manganese, while asa did not. in other experiments, animals exposed to three day treatments with manganese produced a dose dependent impairment of the dopaminergic, cilio inhibitory system, which was decreased by co treatment with pas. the study shows that pas protects the animal against neurotoxic effects of manganese and the mechanism of action of pas in alleviating manganism is more likely related to its chelating abilities than its anti inflammatory actions.",0.39447731755424065,0.15049504950495052,0.27585252423250567
"Psychological and neurobehavioral models suggest that voluntary sleep wake behaviors, such as excessive time in bed and irregular sleep wake timing, may contribute to the development of insomnia (). For example, an individual who experiences a night of poor sleep may try to catch up by staying in bed longer the following morning or by going to bed earlier the following night. Such compensatory behaviors are thought to be maladaptive: increasing time in bed can lead to even worse sleep on subsequent nights, as time in bed further outstrips the individuals actual ability to sleep.10.1016/j.sleep.2009.02.010 We restricted these analyses to the CI group only, given the exploratory nature of the analyses, our specific interest in insomnia, the small size of the NI group, and the floor effects in that group. Only one of 24 correlations was statistically significant at the .05 level: variability in bed time correlated positively with HAM D score (rho = .41, p = 0.001).

"Schools are strategic settings for obesity prevention efforts (; ; ), and decision makers (e.g., state legislators, superintendents, principals) can consider a mix of strategies for schools to adopt to address obesity. One such decision is whether to collect information about student weight status in schools. School based body mass index (BMI) measurement is part of both surveillance and screening efforts.Although school nurses are often in charge of height and weight measurements, the implementation of the recommended safeguards is not solely the school nurses responsibility. Nurses who work in schools that conduct BMI surveillance or screening can make sure they are familiar with the recommended safeguards and assess the extent to which these precautions are in place. Nurses can also communicate the importance of safeguards to administrators and others who have the decision making latitude to advance adoption (e.g., by funding purchases of scales and stadiometers, supporting time for training).Most schools that screened for student BMI had yet to adopt multiple safeguards related to staff training, accurate and reliable equipment, ensuring resources are available for follow up, and sharing results and referral information with parents. These four safeguards are just some of the practices recommended for a school to have in place before launching a BMI measurement program.

"Optical recording of neuronal activity has been in use for a generation now, starting with voltage sensitive dyes , Ca2+ indicators (Grynkiewicz, Poenie et al. 1985), and more recently genetically encoded fluorescent sensors . Perhaps the simplest way to sample network activity using fluorescent indicators is by bath application of membrane permeant high affinity Ca2+ indicators that change fluorescence amplitude (such as Calcium Green AM or fluo 4 AM) to a slice preparation , which loads cells at or near the surface of the tissue sample , whose activity is recorded as a series of images . With these dyes, changes in fluorescence accompanying changes in intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) can be detected in the raw image series, and their salience can be enhanced by simple filtering, such as subtraction of the first image from the rest of the images in the series.Semi automated Region of Interest Generation for the Analysis of Optically Recorded Neuronal Activity 19362155 Figure 1Image processing sequence for ROI extraction.

Membranes with large pores tend to have high filtrate flux but low protein retention, with the reverse being true for membranes with small pores.

Single pores are visible in both membranes, with the pore dimensions remaining constant through the entire depth of the silicon, i.e., over the entire pore length.The results presented in this manuscript provide the first demonstration that ultrafiltration membranes with uniform slit shaped pores can have significantly enhanced performance, as defined by the tradeoff between the selectivity and permeability, compared to traditional ultrafiltration membranes that have cylindrical shaped pores. This improved performance is a direct result of the reduced resistance to flow in a slit shaped pore compared to that in a cylindrical pore of the same critical dimension (rp = h).

"The question of why some low income women and men have children years before they marry, if they ever marry, has interested social scientists for a century, with most of the attention focused on African Americans. Before World War II sociologists such as DuBois (1908), Frazier (1939), and noted the effects on black family life of the heritage of slavery, urbanization, segregation, and discrimination, sometimes drawing cultural distinctions between the poor and the middle class.

"The solvatochromic properties of many environment sensitive fluorophores have been exploited in a wide range of biological applications such as detecting protein peptide binding events ( ), monitoring changes in protein allostery ( ), and reporting various forms of post translational modification (, ). These fluorophores possess emission properties that are highly sensitive to the nature of the immediate solvent environment.

"Progression of osteoarthritis (OA) is characterized by destruction of the articular cartilage and other soft tissues in the joint, such as ligaments and, in the knee, the menisci. This tissue destruction is accompanied by remodeling and hypertrophy of neighboring bone and varying degrees of synovial inflammation . The destruction, remodeling, and inflammation of joint tissues leads to joint failure manifested as joint pain and loss of function.Mitogen Activated Protein Kinases as Therapeutic Targets in Osteoarthritis 18698181 Despite initial animal model studies suggesting that MEK/ERK inhibition would be a potential therapeutic target in OA , inhibitors of the ERK pathway have received little attention in additional animal model studies or in clinical trials in humans. This is most likely because of the potential toxicity of systemic ERK inhibition given the knowledge that the ERK MAP kinase pathway is involved in a multitude of growth factor signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation and tissue homeostasis. JNK and p38 are most commonly activated by inflammatory and stress induced signals and so inhibition of these MAP kinases is thought to have a better risk benefit ratio than ERK inhibition .Accumulating evidence supports a central regulatory role of the MAP kinases in mediating inflammatory and matrix degrading processes that contribute to joint tissue destruction in osteoarthritis. Because MAP kinases also appear to be involved in pain signaling pathways, the potential exists for MAP kinase inhibitors to reduce both pain and structural progression in OA. However, due to the toxicity of the currently available MAP kinase inhibitors, risk benefit considerations have precluded their use in clinical trials in humans with OA.",PMC2892710.json,"purpose of review the mitogen activated protein (map) kinases are intracellular signaling proteins which play a central role in controlling the activity of pathways that regulate production and activity of multiple mediators of joint tissue destruction. the therapeutic potential of map kinase inhibition in osteoarthritis was reviewed. recent findings results from basic research studies support the role of map kinases as central mediators that regulate expression of pro inflammatory cytokines and metalloproteinases but also as potential pain mediators as well. cell culture and animal model studies suggest that inhibition of map kinases might slow progression of osteoarthritis but trials of map kinase inhibitors in humans with osteoarthritis have not yet been reported. safety concerns of the currently available inhibitors have limited their initial use to trials in conditions considered more severe than oa. summary map kinase inhibition has the potential to slow disease progression in osteoarthritis and also might reduce pain; however, safety concerns have limited the use of general map kinase inhibitors in humans. further understanding of the function of specific isoforms of the map kinases as well as upstream and downstream effectors may lead to the development of more specific inhibitors with less toxicity that could eventually be used as structure modifying drugs for oa.",0.5254237288135594,0.17446808510638298,0.28381360931127103
"Normal aging is accompanied by disrupted sleep with increasing sleep fragmentation, nighttime awakenings, and a greater tendency for daytime sleepiness. Disruption of sleep and rest activity patterns has been increasingly recognized as a health hazard due to its association with a number of poor health outcomes, such as cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disease, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and cancer . Sleep and rest activity pattern is one of the key elements of circadian rhythm, a 24 hour pattern of physiology and behavior synchronized with the environmental light dark cycle.The Beaver Dam Eye Study (BDES) is an observational, longitudinal, population based study of age related eye disease in Beaver Dam, WI. The baseline examination (19881990, n = 4926, ages 4384) was followed by a five year (19931995, n=3722) and ten year (19982000, n = 2962) follow up examination, with subsequent examinations at approximately five year intervals. The Epidemiology of Hearing Loss Study (EHLS) is an observational, longitudinal, population based study of age related hearing, olfaction, and cognition in the same cohort as the BDES.While an increasing body of evidence has implicated the impact of the eye on circadian rhythm regulation, the question arises as to whether the intervention for age related eye disease can promote circadian rhythm activity such as sleep.

"Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a technique that can be used to test whether a cortical area is necessary for a given function, by transiently interacting with the normal underlying pattern of neural activity and studying the consequences. For example, if TMS is applied to primary visual cortex (V1) then participants can report having perceived an artificial flash like visual percept, or phosphene. TMS induced phosphenes can be used to explore the neural dynamics underlying visual perception (; ; ; ; ).The main experiment comprised 16 blocks of 40 trials. The task, fixation point and timing was the same as during screening , but rather than use verbal reports, participants executed manual button presses made with the right hand, using the index or third finger to indicate phosphene presence or absence, respectively. Block order was pseudo randomized and counterbalanced: each group of four consecutive blocks included two blocks with occipital TMS on every trial, one with control site TMS, and one without any TMS.Phosphene perception was linked to a differential TMS induced brain activation over central and posterior visual areas, with two positive components between 160200 ms and 280400 ms after TMS onset. This was shown by comparing the TMS evoked potential (TEPs) elicited during visual cortical stimulation at phosphene threshold intensity between trials where phosphenes were perceived and trials where no phosphenes were elicited. The relatively late onset and broad topography of this phosphene related potential, and the fact that electrical brain activity at earlier latencies was unrelated to phosphene perception, provide no support for the hypothesis that phosphenes are an immediate and local consequence of TMS induced activations of visual cortex, but are consistent with the late hypothesis .",PMC2939984.json,"artificial percepts (phosphenes) can be induced by applying transcranial magnetic stimulation (tms) over human visual cortex. although phosphenes have been used to study visual awareness, the neural mechanisms generating them have not yet been delineated. we directly tested the two leading hypotheses of how phosphenes arise. these hypotheses correspond to the two competing views of the neural genesis of awareness: the early, feedforward view and the late, recurrent feedback model. we combined online tms and eeg recordings to investigate whether the electrophysiological correlates of conscious phosphene perception are detectable early after tms onset as an immediate local effect of tms, or only at longer latencies, after interactions of tms induced activity with other visual areas. stimulation was applied at the intensity threshold at which participants saw a phosphene on half of the trials, and brain activity was recorded simultaneously with electroencephalography. phosphene perception was associated with a differential pattern of tms evoked brain potentials that started to ms after stimulation, and encompassed a wide array of posterior areas. this pattern was differentiated from the tms evoked potential after stimulation of a control site. these findings suggest that conscious phosphene perception is not a local phenomenon, but arises only after extensive recurrent processing.",0.49372384937238495,0.12605042016806722,0.2719801453393257

"One of the striking paradoxes of modern medicine is the extremely high frequency of skin cancer despite an enormous body of evidence that identifies UV radiation as a skin carcinogen. Among UV sources, indoor tanning represents a growing, multi billion dollar industry, though its growth comes at a time when there is scientific consensus that exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation increases the risk of developing skin cancer. As evidence of the dangers of UV exposure mounts, the indoor tanning industry has responded with an aggressive public relations campaign, which appears designed to reassure the general public that health benefits of tanning may outweigh the health risks.Indoor UV tanning and skin cancer: health risks and opportunities 19532016 Significant attention has also been directed recently at non Hodgkin lymphoma, though with this malignancy studies have focused more on sun exposure than on vitamin D levels. For example, in a case control study from Germany involving 710 lymphoma patients and an equal number of controls, increased number of vacation days spent at sunny locations was associated with a decreased risk of developing lymphoma (OR = 0.6, 95% CI = 0.4 0.8) . Similarly, total hours of sun exposure per week had a weak negative association with non Hodgkin lymphoma risk among individuals living in Nebraska .Despite claims by the tanning industry, recent evidence supports an association between indoor tanning and increased risk of skin cancers, including BCC, SCC, and melanoma. While association studies have correlated vitamin D levels with protection against various internal malignancies and other disease states, acquiring vitamin D by cutaneous UV exposure is not necessary, and non carcinogenic sources, such as dietary supplementation, are to be preferred. Moreover prospective randomized trials are needed (and some are underway) to directly test the role(s) of vitamin D supplements at varied doses relative to a variety of cancer endpoints.",PMC2913608.json,"purpose of review skin cancer incidence is higher than that of any other human malignancy, and yet one of its root causes (ultraviolet radiation) is perhaps better understood than any other human carcinogen. the roles of ultraviolet radiation exposure and indoor tanning behaviors on skin cancer risk are explored here. recent findings studies from the past several years have shown a significant association between ever use of an indoor tanning facility and an increased risk of basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma. the association between indoor tanning and skin cancer is particularly strong among those who first used a tanning facility in early adulthood. elevated vitamin d levels have been suggested to protect against various internal malignancies and other disease states, but sources of vitamin d that do not require uv exposure are easily available. summary although additional research is needed to understand fully the relationship between uv and skin cancer, it is already clear that indoor tanning bed use represents an avoidable risk factor for melanoma and non melanoma skin cancer both of which may be lethal. acting upon this information provides a unique opportunity for protecting the public health.",0.4510978043912175,0.1282565130260521,0.2794249167841676

While PTx binding to sialic acid has been well described, our discovery of non sialylated complex type N linked glycan binding sites on the S2 and S3 subunits furthers our understanding of PTx binding and activity. It has been known for decades that PTx seems to have a higher affinity for sialylated N glycans compared to other sialylated glycans, which a sialic acid only binding model fails to explain (, , , , ).",PMC2924675.json,"binding of pertussis toxin (ptx) was examined by glycan microarray; positive hits fell into four general groups. one group represents sialylated bi antennary compounds with an n glycan core terminating in 2 6 linked sialic acid. the second group consists of multi antennary compounds with a canonical n glycan core, but lacking terminal sialic acids, which represents a departure from previous understanding of ptx binding to n glycans. the third group consists of neu5ac2 3(lactose or n acetyllactosamine) that lack the branched mannose core found in n glycans, thus their presentation is more similar to o linked glycans and glycolipids. the fourth group of compounds consists of neu5ac2 8neu5ac2 8neu5ac, which is seen in the c series gangliosides and some n glycans. quantitative analysis by spr of the relative affinities of ptx for terminal neu5ac2 3 versus neu5ac2 6, as well as the affinities for the trisaccharide neu5ac2 8neu5ac2 8neu5ac versus disaccharide, revealed identical global affinities, even though the amount of bound glycan varied by 4 to 5 fold. these studies suggest that the conformational space occupied by a glycan can play an important role in binding, independent of affinity. characterization of n terminal and c terminal binding sites on the s2 and s3 subunits by mutational analysis revealed that binding to all sialylated compounds was mediated by the c terminal binding sites, and binding to non sialylated n linked glycans is mediated by the n terminal sites present on both the s2 and s3 subunits. a detailed understanding of the glycans recognized by pertussis toxin is essential to understand which cells are targeted in clinical disease.",0.17412935323383086,0.047322540473225407,0.1224251844026098
"Raising excise taxes on tobacco products is the most effective tobacco control strategy among the policies advocated by the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). However, the effectiveness of increasing excise taxes as a tobacco control means depends on the tax structure, that is, on what basis taxes are levied (quantity vs value vs both) and how tax rates are determined (a single rate vs multiple rates).  There are in total six different types of tax structures: specific uniform (quantity based, a single rate), specific tiered (quantity based, multiple rates), ad valorem uniform (value based, a single rate), ad valorem tiered (value based, multiple rates), mixed uniform (both quantity based and value based, single rates) and mixed tiered (both quantity based and value based, multiple rates).Following Shang et al (2016), we used generalized estimating equations (GEE) to examine the association between tax structures and cigarette consumption using an identity link, inversed Gaussian family and exchangeable correlation setting. GEE is a panel data technique that accounts for intertemporal correlations. The analyses were conducted using the XTGEE .In , we present an overview of the data and measures, including country names, tax structure types, share of ad valorem taxes among total excise taxes, average cigarette consumption per day and the number of ITC survey waves used in the analyses. This table further illustrates that cigarette consumption in Mexico decreased from 7.17 sticks per day under an ad valorem uniform structure to 5.97 sticks per day under a mixed uniform structure, suggesting that a switch to more reliance on specific taxes may be associated with decreased cigarette consumption. In Brazil, cigarette consumption slightly increased from 15.4 per day to 15.71 per day after a change from a specific tiered to a mixed tiered structure .",PMC6702940.json,"background recent studies show that greater price variability and more opportunities for tax avoidance are associated with tax structures that depart from a specific uniform one. these findings indicate that tax structures other than a specific uniform one may lead to more cigarette consumption. objective this paper aims to examine how cigarette tax structure is associated with cigarette consumption. methods we used survey data taken from the international tobacco control policy evaluation project in countries to conduct the analysis. self reported cigarette consumption was aggregated to average measures for each surveyed country and wave. the effect of tax structures on cigarette consumption was estimated using generalized estimating equations after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, average taxes and year fixed effects. findings our study provides important empirical evidence of a relationship between tax structure and cigarette consumption. we find that a change from a specific to an ad valorem structure is associated with a 6%11% higher cigarette consumption. in addition, a change from uniform to tiered structure is associated with a 34%65% higher cigarette consumption. the results are consistent with existing evidence and suggest that a uniform and specific tax structure is the most effective tax structure for reducing tobacco consumption.",0.45875251509054327,0.1575757575757576,0.2547070789030226
"Key aspects of the native endochondral bone development process, as well as bone fracture healing through a cartilaginous callus, can be mimicked in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) through standard in vitro chondrogenic induction. Common features of this process include cartilage matrix formation followed by maturation to a hypertrophic like phenotype, activation of alkaline phosphatase activity and expression of specific matrix components and growth factors such as type X collagen and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (; ; ; ). While up regulation of such bone and vascular markers is viewed as a shortcoming in efforts to regenerate cartilage, exploiting the natural tendency of these cells to progress through a state resembling hypertrophy has recently emerged as an ideal technique for bone tissue engineering .DNA was quantified at the time of pellet and bead synthesis (d0) by pipetting 3 drops of cell containing alginate solution (n = 3) or 3  250 000 cell aliquots of pellet cell suspension (n = 3) directly into centrifuge tubes and processed as described below for d28 samples. For quantification of DNA and sulfated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) accumulation in d28 in vitro samples, 3 pellets or beads were collected per replicate (n = 3) and digested in papain solution (125 g/mL papain, 0.1 M sodium phosphate, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM L cysteine, pH 6.5; all products from Sigma Aldrich) at 60 C overnight . Digests were then frozen for future analysis.The presence of implanted hASCs was assessed by identifying cells positive for human nuclear antigen (HNA). Human cells were thus distinguished from DAPI positive murine cells by dual HNA and DAPI staining. Qualitative assessment indicated that the hASCs persisted in pellets more than in alginate beads.",PMC5773408.json,"key aspects of native endochondral bone development and fracture healing can be mimicked in mesenchymal stem cells (mscs) through standard in vitro chondrogenic induction. exploiting this phenomenon has recently emerged as an attractive technique to engineer bone tissue, however relatively little is known about the best conditions for doing so. the objective of this study was to compare the bone forming capacity and angiogenic induction of hypertrophic cell constructs containing human adipose derived stem cells (hascs) primed for chondrogenesis in two different culture systems: high density pellets and alginate bead hydrogels. hasc constructs were subjected to weeks of identical chondrogenic induction in vitro, encapsulated in an agarose carrier, and then implanted subcutaneously in immune compromised mice for weeks to evaluate their endochondral potential. at the time of implantation, both pellets and beads expressed aggrecan and type ii collagen, as well as alkaline phosphatase (alp) and type x collagen. interestingly, ascs in pellets formed a matrix containing higher glycosaminoglycan and collagen content than that in beads, and alp activity per cell was higher in pellets. however, after weeks in vivo, pellets and beads induced an equivalent volume of mineralized tissue and a comparable level of vascularization. although osteocalcin and osteopontin positive osteogenic tissue and new vascular growth was found within both types of constructs, all appeared to be better distributed throughout the hydrogel beads. the results of this ectopic model indicate that hydrogel culture may be an attractive alternative to cell pellets for bone tissue engineering via the endochondral pathway.",0.4647619047619047,0.16061185468451242,0.28013526056157256
"The unusual properties and versatility of nanomaterials have led to a rapid increase in their production for a wide range of applications. Among these materials are fullerenes, which are especially attractive owing to the many covalent modifications and coatings that can give the compounds modular properties . With its popularity rivaled only by carbon nanotubes (CNTs), the buckyball (C60) is the most commonly investigated closed shape carbon nanomaterial, and varying forms are under development for an array of applications [, ].Numerous analytical methods have been developed for quantification of C60 in a variety of matrices . The typical method for C60 extraction exploits the high solubility of C60 in toluene, with addition of counter ions to destabilize the nC60 particles for quantitative extraction of pristine fullerene and its epoxide. In addition, solid phase extraction of fullerenes from water has been conducted for samples of environmental and biological origin [, ].The current literature reveals the significant potential of fullerenes to undergo transformation in the environment. Therefore, their actual occurrence and environmental concentrations may be significantly greater than those determined experimentally by use of available methods of limited capacity. For a more complete risk assessment of fullerenes, more work will be needed to reveal this currently obscured but putatively substantial fullerene chemistry.",PMC3725142.json,"owing to their exceptional properties and versatility, fullerenes are in widespread use for numerous applications. increased production and use of fullerenes will inevitably result in accelerated environmental release. however, study of the occurrence, fate, and transport of fullerenes in the environment is complicated because a variety of surface modifications can occur as a result of either intentional functionalization or natural processes. to gain a better understanding of the effect and risk of fullerenes on environmental health, it is necessary to acquire reliable data on the parent compounds and their congeners. whereas currently established quantification methods generally focus on analysis of unmodified fullerenes, we discuss in this review the occurrence and analysis of oxidized fullerene congeners (i.e., their corresponding epoxides and polyhydroxylated derivatives) in the environment and in biological specimens. we present possible strategies for detection and quantification of parent nanomaterials and their various derivatives.",0.39886039886039887,0.08595988538681948,0.2426489687438358
"During diastole, blood flows into the ventricular chambers and the tissue in the ventricular walls is stretched. If the ventricular tissue becomes too stiff, the walls present an excessive resistance to inflowing blood and ventricular filling is impaired. This is termed diastolic dysfunction .None Preparations were attached between a force transducer (resonant frequency 600 Hz, model 403, Aurora Scientific, Aurora, Ontario, Canada) and a motor (step time 0.6 ms, model 312B, Aurora) by crimping their ends into metal troughs (shaped from 27 gauge tubing) with overlays of 4 0 nylon monofilament. The technique is illustrated in Fig 1B of Campbell & Moss, 2002.

The increased myocardial stiffness observed in affected patients could reflect increased passive stiffness (due primarily to titin and collagen filaments) or increased active stiffness (due to cross bridges that remain bound to actin filaments during diastole).

"Chromatin remodeling by acetylation of histone molecules plays an essential role in the activation of gene expression. By decreasing the acetylation of lysine residues in histone tails, histone deacetylases (HDACs) condense chromatin structure and repress gene transcription. HDAC inhibitors induce the expression of a subset of genes involved in cell growth arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis, which accounts for the antitumor effects of these compounds .None Science signaling innate immune responses mediated by toll like receptors (tlrs), a class of pattern recognition receptors, play a critical role in the defense against microbial pathogens. however, excessive tlr mediated responses result in sepsis, autoimmunity, and chronic inflammation. to prevent deleterious activation of tlrs, cells have evolved multiple mechanisms that inhibit innate immune reactions.Since its identification in the early 1990s, MKP 1 has been extensively studied in the context of regulating various physiological processes, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, and inflammation.

"Liver fibrosis is the common result of various causes of chronic damage to the liver, including infections, toxins, autoimmune disorder, cholestatic and metabolic diseases . Fibrosis is marked by the gradual replacement of hepatocytes by extracellular collagen, which disturbs the normal architecture of the liver and can inhibit its ability to function. Cirrhosis, the end stage of fibrosis, affects millions of people worldwide.In Vivo Quantification of Liver Stiffness in a Rat Model of Hepatic Fibrosis with Acoustic Radiation Force 19683381 Studies were performed on 5 week old male Sprague Dawley rats weighing 120140g using procedures approved by the Duke University IACUC. Liver fibrosis was induced by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of 1.0ml/kg body weight of 10% carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) in olive oil (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA), three times a week for eight weeks. CCl4 is one of the oldest and most widely used toxins for the induction of liver fibrosis in animals.This study has demonstrated the feasibility of acoustic radiation force as a non invasive method for the quantitative assessment of liver fibrosis in small animals. The mean stiffness of fibrotic (F3) rat livers, as measured by acoustic radiation force, was 1.8  0.2kPa (meanCI), compared with 1.5  0.1kPa for healthy livers, with non overlapping 95% confidence intervals. Liver stiffness measured by acoustic radiation force was linearly correlated with the amount of fibrosis in the liver as quantitatively measured by picosirius red staining (r2 = 0.43, p = 0.008).",PMC2752497.json,"liver fibrosis is currently staged using needle biopsy, a highly invasive procedure with a number of disadvantages. measurement of liver stiffness changes that accompany progression of the disease may provide a quantitative and non invasive method to assess the health of the liver. the purpose of this study is to investigate the correlation between liver stiffness measured by radiation force induced shear waves and disease related changes in the liver. an additional aim is to present initial findings on the effects of liver viscosity on radiation force induced shear wave morphology. liver fibrosis was induced in rats using carbon tetrachloride (ccl4), while rats acted as controls. liver stiffness was measured in vivo in all rats after a treatment period of weeks using a modified siemens sonoline antares scanner. the spatial coherence of radiation force induced shear waves propagating in the viscoelastic rat liver decreased significantly with propagation distance, compared to shear waves in an elastic phantom, and a finite element model of a purely elastic medium. animals were sacrificed after imaging and liver samples were taken for histopathological analysis and collagen quantification using picosirius red staining and hydroxyproline assay. at the end of the treatment period, rats had healthy livers (stage f0), while had severe fibrosis (f3), and the rest had light to moderate fibrosis (f1 and f2). the measured liver stiffness for the f0 group was 1.5 0.1kpa (mean 95% confidence interval), and for f3 livers was 1.8 0.2kpa. in this study, liver stiffness was found to be linearly correlated with the amount of collagen in the liver measured by picosirius red staining (r2 = 0.43, p = 0.008). in addition, stiffness spatial heterogeneity was also linearly correlated with liver collagen content (r2 = 0.58, p = 0.001) by picosirius red staining. these results are consistent with those obtained by salameh et al (2007) and yin et al (2007b) using animal models of liver fibrosis and mr elastography. this suggests that stiffness measurement using acoustic radiation force can provide a quantitative assessment of the extent of fibrosis in the liver and can be potentially used for the diagnosis, management, and study of liver fibrosis.",0.5114754098360655,0.22039473684210525,0.31135364058156006
"Maintenance of stance requires minimal effort despite the fact that the nervous system must account for the complex multi segmental dynamics of the body. This complexity is accounted for in such a way that body sway during quiet stance can be described as an inverted pendulum . To balance this pendulum, torques must be generated from the combined effects of passive muscle and joint properties, feedback mechanisms such as stretch reflexes, and feed forward volitional activation.Regulation of Feed forward and Feedback Strategies at the Human Ankle during Balance Control 19965100 Stretch reflex amplitude varied with the level of external support provided by the environment. illustrates the position perturbations and reflex responses from a typical subject. In each environment, the perturbations elicited a short latency stretch reflex in Sol, MG, LG, and PL without a subsequent long latency response.This study was performed to assess how changes in load stability affect both feed forward and feedback control of ankle posture. We hypothesized that subjects would compensate for reduced postural support by increasing the magnitude of agonist antagonist co contraction and also by increasing stretch reflex excitability. Our results demonstrated that as support was reduced, individuals did indeed increase the magnitude of co contraction to stabilize the load.",PMC2907075.json,"the dynamics of sway during quiet stance have often been approximated by the movement of an unstable inverted pendulum. controlling this unstable load requires the nervous system to balance the reliance on feed forward volitional activation and feedback mechanisms such as stretch reflexes. it has been demonstrated that reflex excitability is heightened when postural stability is threatened by destabilizing forces in the environment. however, the relationship between postural stability, volitional activation, and stretch reflex excitability remains unclear. we addressed this question by characterizing feed forward and feedback activation strategies during balance of a simulated inverted pendulum. we hypothesized that feed forward co contraction and stretch reflex amplitude would scale together as the external support provided by the environment was reduced. electromyographic (emg) responses in muscles of the lower limb were used to characterize co contraction patterns and stretch reflex amplitude as subjects stabilized the simulated loads. our results revealed that co contraction magnitude did indeed scale with increasingly destabilizing torques; however reflex amplitude was attenuated as stability was reduced. these findings suggest that the contribution of feedback mechanisms to postural stability depends on both the level of stability provided by the environment and how the environment influences the pattern of volitional activation.",0.607843137254902,0.22660098522167485,0.36066483574674724
"There is a growing consensus that the teratological effects of prenatal cocaine exposure are subtle, and may occur through several pathways . One such pathway may be through problematic mother infant interactions. Cocaine using mothers are more disengaged and passive during mother infant interactions in the neonatal period , are less flexible and engaged during feeding interactions , have lower responsiveness and enthusiasm in later infancy , are less emotionally engaged in the toddler period , use fewer positive reinforcements and more threats of physical discipline in the toddler/preschool period , and are more hostile and intrusive in a structured teaching situation at 3 years of age .All mothers were screened after delivery for initial eligibility and matching criteria.

"Left ventricular (LV) contraction dyssynchrony is common among patients with systolic heart failure and is associated with significantly greater cardiac risks. Dyssynchronous contraction can be caused by abnormal electrical activation of the LV (e.g., left bundle branch block [LBBB]), structural changes to the myocardium (e.g., areas of scar caused by ischemia), or both, ultimately preventing normal LV activation and contraction. A common abnormal activation sequence observed in patients with LV dyssynchrony occurs between the early activated septum and late activated posterior lateral LV wall.Dyssynchronous contraction with RVOT pacing had an adverse effect on LV energetic function. In spite of lower PVA, dyssynchronous contraction for any given end diastolic volume was associated with greater AVO2 and little change in Qcor . Statistical analysis using the mixed model approach showed that a trend toward a greater MVO2 PVA relationship slope was observed with RVOT pacing (; RA pacing: 1.49  105  0.17  105, RVOT pacing: 1.68  105  0.17  105 mL O2/mmHg/mL, P = 0.055).Following RVOT pacing induced contraction dyssynchrony, global LV mechano energetic function was adversely affected. Although a small but significant depression in global LV mechanical function was observed with RVOT pacing, this contraction pattern was associated with an increase in MVO2 for a given PVA, resulting in decreased myocardial mechanical conversion efficiency (i.e., PVA/MVO2). A possible mechanism explaining the observed increase in MVO2 with dyssynchrony is that the observed PVA at the global level underestimates the internal PVA at the cellular level, which is likely to be the true determinant of MVO2.",PMC2948864.json,"background the effects of dyssynchrony on global left ventricular (lv) mechanics have been well documented; however, its impact on lv energetics has received less attention. objective to assess the effects of lv contraction dyssynchrony on global lv mechano energetic function in a pacing induced acute model of dyssynchrony. methods using blood perfused isolated rabbit heart preparations (n = 11), lv pressure, coronary flow, and arteriovenous oxygen content difference were recorded for isovolumic contractions under right atrial (ra) pacing (control) and simultaneous ra and right ventricular outflow tract (rvot) pacing (dyssynchrony). lv mechanical function was quantified by the end systolic pressure volume relationship (espvr). myocardial oxygen consumption pressure volume area (mvo2 pva) relationship quantified lv energetic function. internal pva for mvo2rvot was calculated based on the mvo2 pva relationship for ra pacing. thus, lost pva (internal pva pvarvot) represents the mechanical energy not observable at the global level. results compared to ra pacing, rvot pacing depressed lv mechanics as indicated by a rightward shift of espvr (i.e., increase in vd from 0.58 0.10 to 0.67 0.10 ml, p < 0.05). despite depressed mechanics, rvot pacing was associated with greater mvo2 such that the mvo2 pva relationship intercept was markedly increased from 0.025 0.003 to 0.029 0.003 mlo2/beat/100glv (p < 0.05). excess mvo2 (i.e., mvo2rvot mvo2ra) significantly correlated with lost pva (r2 = 0.54, p < 0.001). conclusion a potential mechanism explaining the observed increase in mvo2 with dyssynchrony may be that the measured pva at the global level underestimates the internal pva at the cellular level, which is likely to be the true determinant of mvo2.",0.4878957169459963,0.2280373831775701,0.37217583518937025

"Racial and ethnic disparities in the quality of nursing home care have been documented for multiple chronic conditions and nursing areas.[] A large body of literature has also reported that widespread disparities exist across facilities essentially because racial/ethnic minority residents tend to be cared for in facilities with limited financial and clinical resources and high numbers of care deficiencies.[] In a landmark study conducted more than a decade ago, Vincent Mor and coauthors reported that across the United States 40 percent of black residents, but only 9 percent of whites, resided in these lower tier facilities .

"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory destructive arthritis of unclear etiology and affects approximately 1% of the general population. Although there is no cure for RA, disease modifying anti rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are the mainstay of therapy and are used to decrease the rate of joint destruction, reduce inflammation, and improve quality of life .

"This paper describes a simple SlipChip based method for counting nucleic acid molecules via digital PCR. Digital PCR is a powerful method to detect rare cells and count cells, DNA, and RNA, and relies on the single molecule sensitivity of PCR. At the single molecule level, confining the molecule in a small volume increases the relative concentration, thus increasing the sensitivity.All solvents and salts purchased from commercial sources were used as received unless otherwise stated. SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix (2) was purchased from Bio Rad Laboratories (Hercules, CA). Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was purchased from Roche Diagnostics (Indianapolis, IN).Here we found that the SlipChip was capable of accurately quantifying the amount of nucleic acid present in a sample using standard thermal cycling PCR techniques in a digital format. The SlipChip contained 1,280 wells designed to separate microliter sample into 1,280 droplets of 2.6 nL each, and was capable of detecting the template DNA at single copy level. The upper limit of concentration that could be detected using this device can be increased by decreasing the individual well volume and/or increasing the number of wells on the SlipChip, and the sensitivity of the device can be improved by increasing the total well volume.",PMC2948063.json,"summary this paper describes a slipchip to perform digital pcr in a very simple and inexpensive format. the fluidic path for introducing the sample combined with the pcr mixture was formed using elongated wells in the two plates of the slipchip designed to overlap during sample loading. this fluidic path was broken up by simple slipping of the two plates that removed the overlap among wells and brought each well in contact with a reservoir preloaded with oil to generate 1,280 reaction compartments (2.6 nl each) simultaneously. after thermal cycling, end point fluorescence intensity was used to detect the presence of nucleic acid. digital pcr on the slipchip was tested quantitatively by using staphylococcus aureus genomic dna. as the concentration of the template dna in the reaction mixture was diluted, the fraction of positive wells decreased as expected from the statistical analysis. no cross contamination was observed during the experiments. at the extremes of the dynamic range of digital pcr the standard confidence interval determined using a normal approximation of the binomial distribution is not satisfactory. therefore, statistical analysis based on the score method was used to establish these confidence intervals. the slipchip provides a simple strategy to count nucleic acids by using pcr. it may find applications in research applications such as single cell analysis, prenatal diagnostics, and point of care diagnostics. slipchip would become valuable for diagnostics, including applications in resource limited areas after integration with isothermal nucleic acid amplification technologies and visual readout.",0.47032967032967027,0.13245033112582782,0.2544708888759981
"Fluorescence tomography is a rapidly expanding field of study in which traditional planar fluorescence imagery is being fused with many other modern technologies, among which target specific probes and tomographical reconstruction methods are the most notable ones. Because of the highly scattering and absorbing nature of biological tissue, light propagation in the animal is dominated by diffusion, and as a result, tomographic fluorescence imaging is often termed fluorescence diffuse optical tomography (FDOT). Near infrared (NIR) light sources are the primary choices in FDOT because of the relatively good penetration of NIR light in tissue as a result of the relatively low absorption coefficient of hemoglobin and water, and the relatively low autofluorescence compared to visible or ultraviolet light .10.1117/12.808199 Computing the precise surface contour of the animal is essential to solving the forward problem and accurate image registration. We use a white light emitting diode (LED) light source equipped with a ground glass diffuser (LIU004 and DG20120, Thorlabs, Newton, NJ) to illuminate the animal while taking a white light CCD image at each rotation angle. Because this very diffusive LED light source is mounted just above the camera lens and also because it is far away from the animal compared to the dimensions of the animal, the animal can be considered as being illuminated by a parallel light source.The fluorescence images reconstructed from our initial phantom experimental data are shown in .

"Digital x ray imaging has gained wide acceptance in diagnostic clinical practice because of its many useful features compared to screenfilm systems, such as wide dynamic range, image processing through gray scale manipulation, rapid sequence acquisitions and good image quality at reduced dose (, ). Flat panel detectors (FPD) based on thin film transistor arrays are now considered as an alternative to conventional x ray image intensifiers (XII) because they provide geometric distortion and veiling glare free images . In addition to the conventional digital radiographic applications, these systems are also being used in low dose, real time, digital fluoroscopic imaging for navigation and localization of endovascular devices.The sets of measurements presented in this paper were performed with four different detectors to demonstrate the usefulness of this metric. Three of these were custom designed CCD based detectors of different sensitivities, referred to as the micro angiographic fluoroscopic detector (MAF), the high sensitivity micro angiographic fluoroscopic detector (HSMAF) and the micro angiographic detector (MA). The key differences between the three detectors are in their CCD camera coupling arrangements (direct fiber optic coupling in the MA and the HSMAF versus mirror lens coupling in the MAF) and whether there is an additional gain stage (no additional gain in the MA versus an added variable gain dual stage micro channel plate (MCP) light image intensifier (LII) in the MAF and the HSMAF).A simple formal treatment of the instrumentation noise in terms of the detector entrance exposure was developed and applied to three custom designed CCD fiber optic based systems of different sensitivities and to a commercial x ray image intensifier system, and was compared with values for a flat panel detector system reported by other investigators. The instrumentation noise equivalent exposure formalism provides a useful means of separating the system instrumentation noise and the photon fluence dependent quantum noise.

To examine the potential impact of carbamylation on a top down LCMS/MS workflow, the E. coli ribosome containing 56 proteins was used as a benchmark mixture. shows the base peak LCMS traces for a mixture of ribosomal proteins prior to and after carbamylation.This study focuses on evaluating the impact of modifying charge sites (Lys, N termini) of intact proteins on the outcome and metrics of HCD and UVPD. Six model proteins and a ribosomal protein mixture were introduced using infusion or via nanoLC, respectively, then subjected to HCD and UVPD. In particular, this work aims to compare the fragmentation of carbamylated and unmodified proteins to evaluate the influence of mobile protons and charge state upon HCD and UVPD.",PMC5624212.json,"we evaluate the impact of carbamylation of the primary amines of the side chains of lys and the n termini on the fragmentation of intact protein ions and the chromatographic properties of a mixture of e. coli ribosomal proteins. the fragmentation patterns of the six unmodified and carbamylated proteins obtained by higher energy collision dissociation (hcd) and ultraviolet photodissociation (uvpd) were compared. carbamylation significantly reduced the total number of protons retained by the protein owing to the conversion of basic primary amines to non basic carbamates. carbamylation caused a significant negative impact on fragmentation of the protein by hcd (i.e., reduced sequence coverage and fewer diagnostic fragment ions) consistent with the mobile proton model, which correlates peptide fragmentation with charge distribution and the opportunity for charge directed pathways. in addition, fragmentation was enhanced near the n and c termini upon hcd of carbamylated proteins. for lcms/ms analysis of e. coli ribosomal proteins, the retention times increased by min on average upon carbamylation, an outcome attributed to the increased hydrophobicity of the proteins after carbamylation. as noted for both the six model proteins and the ribosomal proteins, carbamylation had relatively little impact on the distribution or types of fragment ions product by uvpd, supporting the proposition that the mechanism of uvpd for intact proteins does not reflect the mobile proton model.",0.4820717131474104,0.15599999999999997,0.3079290659818457

"Maternal disorders such as postpartum depression and anxiety (PPD/A) affect women within 4 weeks of childbirth. Prevalence rates vary from 10 to 20% in most populations , but are higher than 30% in some populations, such as among women living in rural areas of developing countries and among low income, ethnic minority women . These disorders can have robust adverse effects on the health and well being of both the mother and the offspring.The CSS dams were subjected to a CSS protocol from days 2 to 16 of lactation, as reported previously . This procedure included placing a similarly sized (220300 g) novel SpragueDawley male intruder into a lactating females home cage (10.5 inch W  19 inch D  8 inch H) for 1 h from days 2 to 16 of lactation. Control dams were not exposed to the CSS protocol; they were only tested for maternal care and maternal aggression on days 2, 9, and 16 of lactation.The data support the hypothesis that social stress during lactation can not only have profound effects on the ability of a dam to provide care to her offspring, it can also induce other relevant biomarkers of psychopathology, such as impaired lactation and increased maternal anxiety and restlessness. The behavioral changes induced by CSS are correlated with changes in specific neuropeptide systems in the brain of CSS dams, which may be epigenetically mediating the behavioral effects of social stress during this critical period.

"A method for mapping genes by using admixed populations, first described by Chakraborty and Weiss , is based on the finding that recently admixed groups have increased levels of linkage disequilibrium (LD) as a result of the intermixing of two or more previously separated populations. In admixed populations this process may result in significant linkage disequilibrium between unlinked marker loci which have large allele frequency differences in the ancestral populations . One such group with a genetically admixed background is Mexican Americans, a subgroup of Hispanics .Subjects from two San Antonio based studies (SAFDS and SABOR) were used in this study . The discrepancy rate on 5% duplicate genotyping was < 0.2% and the call rate was  97%. No Mendelian inconsistencies were observed among the family based SAFDS samples when using the program SimWalk2 .Studies of common diseases for which risk varies with admixture proportions might lead to false positive or false negative association, in particular at loci where allele frequencies vary between subpopulations . Therefore knowing the proportion of an individuals ancestry that originated from different populations will help reduce the risk of confounding due to population substructure and admixture and thereby help in identifying true genetic and environmental factors that underlie complex diseases.

"During speech, accurate motor control of the vocal articulators is critical for producing an intelligible utterance. In some models, initial motor control is believed to be driven by paired forward and inverse motor models . Forward models predict the next state (position and velocity) of the system based on its current state and active motor command.We found that the onset trials caused a shift in the initial F0 of the following trials, even when an onset trial was preceded by a control trial, indicating some level of single trial adaptation. This finding is consistent with the results of who found that compensation responses carried over within and between trials when speaking a nonsense word. Such single trial adaptation has also been found in arm reaching, with perturbations within a trial affecting subsequent trials .In this study, we have shown that the compensation response at utterance onset is larger than the compensation response to a perturbation mid utterance.

"Establishing and maintaining close friendships is a central developmental task of middle childhood, yet the quality of childrens friendships varies widely . Although not the only contributor to friendship quality, the intimate, dyadic nature of attachment relationships is posited to be especially germane to childrens close relationships, such as friendships, compared with more general indices of social adjustment (see ; ; ). In line with this view, child mother attachment security has been related in theoretically expected ways to childrens friendship quality (e.g., ; ; ; ), and in a meta analysis of attachment peer associations, reported a larger effect size for studies of childrens close friendships versus studies of childrens interactions with unfamiliar peers (also see ).Child mother attachment was assessed using a modified Strange Situation procedure at 36 months, and mother child affective mutuality was assessed from a series of mother child interactive tasks at 54 months. For coding purposes, all videotapes for a given assessment were shipped to a central site, and different coding teams (who were blind to participant characteristics and other study results) assessed child mother attachment security and affective mutuality. Child interviews were conducted at 54 months and grade 1 to assess hostile attributions and language ability.Early attachment relationships are hypothesized to guide childrens later interactions with others, especially close others, via internal working models of the self, other, and relationships. Despite the centrality of this premise to attachment theory, little is known about mechanisms that may account for associations between child mother attachment security and childrens subsequent close relationships with peers.

"Neuropeptides orchestrate numerous complex behaviors in insects. The process of ecdysis, in which insects shed their old cuticle and replace it with a new one, is beautifully controlled by the regulated release of six different bioactive peptides . Two of these peptides, crustacean cardioactive peptide (CCAP) and bursicon, are involved in regulating the last phases of ecdysis, i.e. the motor pattern for shedding the remains of the old cuticle , and for controlling the hardening of the new soft cuticle after shedding , respectively.Two peptide transmitters co packaged in a single neurosecretory vesicle 18848852 Analyses of Cell 27 neuron ultrastructure were performed using standard TEM techniques, as reported previously [, ].

"Assessments of therapist competence are essential to both psychotherapy research and practice . In treatment outcome research, such assessments are potentially critical in interpreting the results of clinical trials . In efforts to disseminate treatments to clinical practice, the construct of therapist competence is seen as vital .Raters (DRS and MAB) had completed all graduate coursework and a one year practicum focused on training in CT at the University of Pennsylvania prior to providing ratings for this study. Raters had also participated in rater training on the CTS with experts in CT, and they practiced rating CT sessions together to ensure adequate rater agreement. Each tape was rated independently by both raters, who were blind to outcome.To our knowledge, our findings provide the first evidence that variability in rated CT competence is associated with subsequent variability in symptom change in a context in which this association could not be driven by improvements in outcome facilitating greater competence.

"It is an honor to be part of the 50th Anniversary tribute to this Journal which has, and still does, play an integral part in my postgraduate education. The invitation to contrast the role of observational and experimental research is a tribute to the growing importance of evidence base in our field. The boundaries between observational and experimental are fuzzy; but I will take observational studies to refer primarily to epidemiological work, and to a lesser extent clinical observation and insights.Psychopharmacological research is clearly experimental, and the story of stimulant drug treatment is core to the history of child psychiatry. Building on earlier observation of the quieting effects of Benzedrine in restless children having diagnostic pneumoencephalograms , the first truly experimental psychopharmacological studies of childhood were carried out. The early studies of Keith Conners and Leon Eisenberg documented the dramatic effect of stimulant medication on impulsive and inattentive behaviors .Child psychiatry is in a very different place than it was 50 years ago. The pioneering studies cited in this review are now replaced by much more sophisticated, epidemiological, long term prospective follow up and multicenter treatment studies.

"Mediating variables are central to theories in education and the social sciences whereby a mediating variable is hypothesized to transmit the effect of an independent variable to a dependent variable. Statistical mediation analysis quantifies the influence of the independent variable on the dependent variable through the mediator by the mediated effect .

Cheung & Lau, 2007; ; ; ) .For the replication of the simulation study, data sets were generated under the two different SEMs the authors investigated (see for SEM with paths labeled as a, b, or c paths). Each of the models consisted of four latent variables, each defined by five indicators with decreasing reliabilities. The latent variables were identified by constraining the first item to have a factor loading of 1 and the rest of the factor loadings were .9, .8, .7, and .6.The first purpose of this article was to reproduce the results from the simulation of to confirm the findings of the original study. The two replication simulations that we carried out generally replicated the results from the original study and demonstrated that the correlations between the a and b paths in these simulations were negative on average thus leading to underpowered tests of the mediated effect when ignoring these correlations.

"The nervous system functions by relaying signals between neighboring neurons, sometimes over long distances and in complex circuits. The wiring of the brain consists of axons, neurites, dendrites, and specialized synaptic endings that ensure proper communication between cells. Neurite and dendrite outgrowth is a dynamic and energy dependent process that, if altered, may lead to a loss of synaptic function and various disease states.For these studies, we used the PC12.XL cell line, which was derived in our laboratory and is a variant of the ATCC PC12 line . These cells show much greater adherence to plastic surfaces than the parental line and do not require adhesion substrata to undergo neuronal differentiation. In the first set of experiments, neuroprotective compounds were tested in combination with NGF to determine whether they acted like olanzapine.Identification of compounds that promote neurite outgrowth is usually based on prior knowledge of a target molecule like a cell surface receptor. Combinatorial screening has been used in cases where the target is unknown (Ronn et al. 1999; Ditlevsen et al. 2003; Ralets et al. 2004).

To determine this, physicians must first ask what we are looking to achieve in patients with acute leukemia, and whether the alternatives to allogeneic transplant are achieving the desired goal.Should double cord blood transplants be the preferred choice when a sibling donor is unavailable? 19959107 The fetal immune system has unique properties that are advantageous in regard to transplantation. Fetal T cells proliferate normally in the presence of alloantigens but do not kill target cells in vitro in the same way as allogeneic T cells from an adult donor.It is too early to definitively say that double umbilical cord blood transplant should be the preferred stem cell choice when a sibling donor is unavailable. However, it is clear that the co infusion of two umbilical cord blood units extends the application of transplant in general to nearly all patients. Furthermore, umbilical cord blood is rapidly available, it now has a high rate of engraftment with improved cytoreductive therapies and higher thresholds for cell dose, and it is generally associated with a low risk of grade 3 or 4 acute graft vs host disease and extensive chronic graft vs host disease.",PMC2789272.json,"umbilical cord blood transplant is an important alternative stem cell source for both children and adults with hematologic malignancies. umbilical cord blood units are rapidly available and have less stringent human leukocyte antigen (hla) matching requirements. mismatch at two antigens actually improves the risk of relapse for umbilical cord blood transplant recipients with relatively low risk of severe acute or chronic graft vs host disease. however, umbilical cord blood transplant is associated with an inferior neutrophil recovery rate when compared to other stem cell sources. it is for this reason that we have explored double unit umbilical cord blood transplants, not only as a platform for evaluating the safety and effectiveness of new methods of ex vivo expansion or methods of enhanced homing, but also as an approach itself to remedy the problem of limited cell dose, particularly for adults.",0.41145833333333337,0.14659685863874344,0.24912717498788334
"The recent explosive growth of human populations has produced an abundance of genetic variants with minor allele frequencies (MAF) less than 1%. While many rare variants underlying Mendelian diseases have been found, their role in complex disease remains unknown. Evolutionary models predict that the contribution of rare variants to complex disease is highly dependent on selection strength,, and that population growth can magnify their impact.Across a broad range of parameters, the accuracy of heritability inference improves as the number of SNP bins (partitioned by MAF) increases.

(bf)There is great interest in characterizing the genetic basis for complex traits to improve our understanding of human health and disease, and substantial resources are being spent to collect ever larger cohorts to investigate the role of rare variants. Such studies will clarify what we have learned from our relatively small study of just 360 individuals.

"Electromagnetic radiation incident on noble metal nanoparticles can excite a coherent collective oscillation of the conduction band electrons. The resonance wavelength of this localized surface plasmon (LSP) depends on the shape, size and the material of the particle as well as the refractive index of the surrounding environment. Tunable electromagnetic coupling of LSPs in close by nanoparticles makes individual nanoparticles versatile building blocks for engineering higher order structures with entirely new properties.Nanoparticle clusters were formed on indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass through a combination of e beam lithography and template guided self assembly. Briefly, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) resist was spincoated on an ITO glass chip to form a layer with a final thickness of ~120 nm. Then binding sites with variable diameters between 80 to 200 nm were generated in the PMMA layer with electron beam lithography using a Zeiss Supra 40 VP SEM equipped with an e beam blanker and through subsequent development with methyl isobutyl ketone/ isopropanol solvent mix (1:3 in volume).Individual nanoparticle clusters (n  7) were constructed from 60 nm gold nanoparticles using a template guided self assembly procedure.

"Encouraging sustained highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) adherence has inspired a multitude of behavioral and cognitive interventions that have relied heavily on the transtheoretical model (TTM) as a framework. Interventions that focus on the TTM, specifically how processes of change can be cultivated and/or manipulated to produce movement along the stages of the change cycle, have been very effective to understanding further what motivates a person to change and sustain that change []. The purpose of this paper was to investigate the critical role that self reevaluation, one of the TTM processes of change, played in sustaining viral load improvement at 6 months for HIV+ individuals currently using HAART and classified as hazardous drinkers.Project Positive Living through Understanding and Support (PLUS) is an eight session, manual driven, individual intervention that integrates motivational interviewing with cognitive behavioral therapy, designed to reduce alcohol abuse and increase HAART adherence for adult HIV+ men and women. The intervention also integrated elements of the TTM, particularly in terms of the motivational interviewing (MI) elements, and therapists were trained on the use of processes of change, as outlined by the TTM. Project PLUS found that alcohol abuse was a significant risk factor for poor medication adherence among hazardous drinkers and Project PLUS is one of the few behavioral interventions to demonstrate significant improvement in treatment vs. control on both biological (i.e., viral load) and behavioral measures of adherence .The current research highlights the importance of self reevaluation. For hazardous drinking HIV+ persons, regardless of participation in either the intervention or series of educational sessions, actively engaging in some amount of cognitive reappraisal of behaviors contributed to sustained viral load improvement at 6 months. It is important to note that there was a greater change in self reevaluation in the therapy condition when compared to the education condition over the intervention period.",PMC2939147.json,"self reevaluation is one of the ten processes of change in the transtheoretical model and involves cognitive reappraisal of how behavior change is part of ones identity. although self reevaluation is a critical motivator for individuals in the contemplation stage of change, few studies have examined its impact on disease progression associated with sustained behavior change. this study investigated the contribution of self reevaluation on sustained viral load improvement among participants in a randomized controlled trial testing an eight session intervention (project positive living through understanding and support) designed to improve treatment adherence among hiv+ adults with alcohol problems. participants self reevaluation scores at months emerged as significant and independent predictors of sustained improvement in viral load at months, over and above self reported haart dose adherence (p<0.05). results underscore the role of self reevaluation as a critical factor in behavioral interventions and highlight its role in sustained change necessary to slow disease progression.",0.4794816414686825,0.16052060737527116,0.29493965658813626

"Bone stiffness, the relationship between applied load and induced tissue strain, is modulated by bone morphology and tissue material properties. Because tissue level strain is a critical regulator of bone growth and remodeling (; ; ), understanding how stiffness is regulated by bone morphology and material properties during development is important for designing biophysical stimuli to promote healthy bone growth and prevent bone loss .

"Violent behavior (both victimization and aggression) and drug using behavior are major social issue among adolescents in the United States (US).

During adolescence, the frequency of both violent behavior and drug using behavior start to increase, with maladaptive consequences that can include incarceration, as well as both fatal and non fatal injuries, often linked with co occurrence of violence and drug use (; ; ; ) .The EM algorithm is repeated until the increase in the log likelihood is small enough to be considered near the solution. This procedure stops if the increase in the log likelihood is less than a pre specified level, or the maximum absolute deviation (MAD) of the successive estimates during the procedure is less than a pre specified threshold. The stopping rule in the EM step is relatively weaker than that of a conventional EM algorithm, because the EM method tends to experience small increases in the log likelihood near the solution.This paper proposes a new latent variable model that can be used to examine underlying joint patterns of multiple latent class variables, whereas the traditional LCA only identifies a small number of classes of a single discrete latent variable.

"Continued developments in imaging mass spectrometry (MS) have provided a variety of techniques to report on the distribution of endogenous molecules and xenobiotics in biological tissues. The biological sciences and drug discovery have benefited from imaging MS methods, such as matrix assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), and most recently, nanostructure initiator mass spectrometry (NIMS). These techniques have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in molecular imaging of animal tissue and whole body ections under vacuum conditions.Simultaneous Imaging of Small Metabolites and Lipids in Rat Brain Tissues at Atmospheric Pressure by Laser Ablation Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry 20050678 To explore the spatial correlation of metabolite distributions simple Pearson product moment cross correlation coefficients, ij, were calculated between all possible pairs of ion intensity distributions, Ii(r) and Ij(r): i,j=cov(Ii(r),Ij(r))/(ij) where cov is the covariance of the two ion intensities in the image and i and j stand for their standard deviations, respectively.

The three primary antioxidant enzymes are superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and glutathione peroxidase (GPx).Quantification of lipid peroxidation is essential to assess the role of oxidative injury . Lipid peroxidation results in the formation of lipid hydroperoxide (LPO) that can then be used to indicate the levels of lipid peroxidation in cardiac tissue. Lipid peroxidation was measured with a LPO assay kit (Cayman Chemical, Michigan) according to the manufacturer's instructions.In the present study, we demonstrated that exercise training after MI provides beneficial effects on cardiac function and LV remodeling by increasing catalase protein and activity.

"Accurate assessment of lymph nodes plays an important role in the clinical diagnosis, staging, and response assessment of patients with cancer . However, lymph node segmentation is challenging, and labor intensive and prone to variability and error when performed manually on computed tomography (CT) images.

Here, we treat lymph node stations as anatomic objects, but key anatomic organs as anchor objects of reference for nodal zones. In the AAR framework, it is essential to build a hierarchy for arranging all objects (lymph node stations or anatomic organs).In comparison to our previous work , the recognition result for IASLC defined thoracic lymph node stations has significantly improved, especially for Station12 and Station56.

"A longstanding debate in the memory literature has been to determine if recognition memory is best explained by single or dual process theories of memory. Single process theories propose that recognition judgments are based on assessments of a single underlying memory strength signal (e.g., ; ; ; ), whereas dual process theories argue that recognition is based on either assessments familiarity or on the products of a recollection process whereby qualitative information about the study event is retrieved (e.g., ; ; ; ). Discriminating between single and dual process theories has been difficult because they often provide equally good accounts of the data even when they lead to entirely different theoretical interpretations of the results (e.g., ; ).Memory strength and variance was assessed by plotting the hit rate against the false alarm rate as a function of response confidence and analyzing the resulting receiver operating characteristics (ROCs) using signal detection theory (for review see ). When the ROC is plotted on z coordinates, the intercept of the z ROC provides a rough index of recognition memory strength or sensitivity, such that a higher intercept reflects better sensitivity. Moreover, the slope of the z ROC provides a measure of the relative variance of the old and new items (i.e., snew/sold).presents the proportion of responses in each confidence bin given to old and new items in both the pure and mixed study lists, as well as the proportion of items that were given a remember response (hatched area).

"There has been a growing realization that the increased resistance to antibiotics in pathogenic microbes is being manifested in serious problems for infected patients worldwide . Due to the resistance to antibiotics, many drugs that were once mainstay therapeutics have become ineffective and are no longer utilized. To fill the void left by obsolete/resistant antibiotics, there has been a widespread push to develop antibiotics that elicit their effects via new molecular targets.19191548 Based on the structural and binding data, it is clearly evident that actinonin binds to PDFEc in a competitive manner with a 1:1 stoichiometry of actinonin to the enzyme (refer to ). As two independent binding sites were observed in our calorimetric titration experiments, it appeared plausible that the origin of these sites was based on the enzyme population containing two types of metal ions. Should this be the case, the removal of the active site Ni2+ would result in the loss of one of the binding phases (corresponding to PDFEc Ni2+) while leaving the phase associated with PDFEc Zn2+ (since it is considered nearly impossible to remove bound Zn2+).The purification protocol for the recombinant form of E. coli PDF consistently yielded large quantities of active enzyme which exhibited a single band on the SDS PAGE at approximately 22 kD (as reported previously for the recombinant PDFEc preparations; ), attesting to an apparent homogeneity of the enzyme preparation. The latter feature implied that the purified PDFEc predominated in a single population state. However, due to its differential avidity for the metal cofactors, the homogenous preparation of the enzyme can have different types of metal bound forms, and such forms may exhibit differential kinetic and thermodynamic properties .",PMC2644421.json,"we investigated the binding of a naturally occurring antibiotic, actinonin, to the ni2+ reconstituted recombinant form of e. coli peptide deformylase (pdfec) via isothermal titration microcalorimetry. the binding data conformed to both exothermic and endothermic phases with magnitudes of g, h, and ts being equal to 12, 2.7, and 9.3, and 8.7, 3.9, and 12.6 kcal/mol, respectively. evidently, although both phases are dominated by favorable entropic changes, the exothermic phase has about 6.7 kcal/mol enthalpic advantage over the endothermic phase. we observed that the removal of bound ni2+ from pdfec abolished the exothermic phase without affecting the endothermic phase, but it was regained upon addition of zn2+. in conjunction with metal analysis data, we propose that the recombinant form of pdfec is expressed in two stable conformational states that yield markedly distinct itc profiles (i.e., exothermic versus endothermic) upon interaction with actinonin. the existence of two conformational states of pdfec is further supported by the observation of two distinct and independent transitions during the thermal unfolding of the enzyme. in addition, the thermodynamic data reveals that the formation of the pdfec actinonin complex results in the transfer of one h+ from the enzyme phase to the bulk solvent at ph 6.3. both exothermic and endothermic phases produce highly negative cp values, but there is no apparent enthalpy entropy compensation effect upon formation of the pdfec actinonin complex. in view of the known structural features of the enzyme, arguments are presented that the alternative conformational states of pdfec are modulated by the metal ligation at the enzyme site.",0.4175824175824176,0.09926470588235294,0.2591436055859835

Evidence from animal models of congenital deafness has revealed abnormal formation of auditory nerve fibers that terminate in the lower brainstem .An electrode cap (Neuroscan Quickcap) with 64 sintered Ag/AgCl electrodes was placed on the participants head. Electrode positions were based on the Extended International 1020 system for electrode placement. Two additional bi polar channels were included to monitor eye movement, and were placed at the right and left lateral canthi and superior and inferior orbits of the left eye.We have found differences in generator sites for the P1 CAEP in normal hearing children, children who received a cochlear implant early in childhood and in children who received an implant later in childhood. We suggest that these differences are engendered by different degrees of cortical reorganization following different durations of deafness. It is important to note, however, that current density reconstructions and group dipole fits were performed on group average data, which inherently includes some expected variability from individual subjects.",PMC2783508.json,"congenital deafness leads to atypical organization of the auditory nervous system. however, the extent to which auditory pathways reorganize during deafness is not well understood. we recorded cortical auditory evoked potentials in normal hearing children and in congenitally deaf children fitted with cochlear implants. high density eeg and source modeling revealed principal activity from auditory cortex in normal hearing and early implanted children. however, children implanted after a critical period of seven years revealed activity from parietotemporal cortex in response to auditory stimulation, demonstrating reorganized cortical pathways. reorganization of central auditory pathways is limited by the age at which implantation occurs, and may help explain the benefits and limitations of implantation in congenitally deaf children.",0.3584905660377358,0.056962025316455694,0.20798544825085521
"SCANNING LASER POLARIMETRY IS DESIGNED TO PROvide real time objective measurements for assessing the thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL). It is based on the principle that the birefringent RNFL induces a change in retardation of passing polarized light that is proportional to its thickness. Because the cornea (nd to a lesser extent the lens) also exhibits birefringence and induces retardation on polarized light, it needs to be neutralized to extract the RNFL retardation from the total retardation in a particular eye.10.1016/j.ajo.2009.01.021 Random coefficients models were used to evaluate the relationship between atypical patterns of retardation and RNFL thickness measurements over time.

"Lateral masking refers to reduced visibility of one stimulus (the target) that is caused by another spatially proximate but non overlapping stimulus (the mask). The mask can either precede the target (paracontrast masking) or follow the target (metacontrast masking) in time. A particularly striking form of lateral masking that involves both paracontrast and metacontrast masking occurs when the target and masks are presented in a continuous cycle (eg ).2.1 Participants had to judge the visibility of the central bar, using one of seven possible keys (1 to 7 on the central keyboard). Participants were instructed to press the 1 key when the central bar was invisible, and the 7 key whenever the central bar was entirely visible, and any key in between according to how visible the central bar appeared to them. Participants were informed that they could base their judgment on either of the masking displays or both of them, as they would always be identical .Mean group responses for individual observers were submitted to a 4 (flanker duration)  7 (separation)  6 (interstimulus interval, ISI) analysis of variance (ANOVA).

"Efforts to identify a single optimal diet for the treatment of obesity have largely failed. This has given rise to numerous fad diets that confuse the public, and has led to the conclusion that macronutrient composition does not affect weight loss . While true, on average, less is known about biomarkers that could identify which types of macronutrient mixes are best for different types of people .In the original trial, 307 participants were randomized to an ad libitum low carbohydrate diet (n=153) or a hypocaloric low fat diet (n=154) for 24 months. The intent with the low carbohydrate diet was to follow recommendations provided in Dr. Atkins New Diet Revolution . During the first three months the ad libitum low carbohydrate diet contained 20 g of carbohydrates/day, consisting of low glycemic index vegetables, followed by a 5g/day increase per week by consuming more vegetables, fruits and whole grain until a stable desired weight was achieved.The results from this study confirm that the combination of FPG and FI is an important biomarker of the weight loss response to diets varying in macronutrient composition and extend this also to include studies with long time follow up and very low carbohydrate diets. Despite two profoundly different diets eliciting nearly identical changes in body weight at all time points, substantial long term, diet specific body weight responses were observed when subjects were stratified according to their pretreatment FPG and FI levels .

With ED visits increasing overall and the number of hospital EDs decreasing over the past decade, a greater burden has been placed on existing facilities .Overall, 4% (weighted) of the sample reported perpetrating IPV at least once in the past year, representing nearly 1.5 million cohabiting or married male perpetrators in the U.S. Black and Hispanic men were disproportionately represented among perpetrators . Younger age, not currently married to cohabiting partner, lower income, unemployed status, and having no or government subsidized health insurance were significantly associated with IPV. The prevalence of serious mental illness was three times greater among perpetrators compared to nonperpetrators.The results of this study indicate that men who perpetrate IPV are more likely to have used ED services in the previous 12 months. Drug abuse and dependence, transportation related risk taking, and serious mental illness were independently associated with ED use. Screening for IPV, as well as risk taking behavior and mental illness, among men accessing ED services may increase opportunities for intervention and referral .",PMC3040786.json,"background intimate partner violence (ipv) perpetration and emergency department (ed) use share common risk factors, such as risk taking behaviors, but little is known about the relationship between ipv perpetration and ed use or the effect of risk taking on this relationship. study objectives this study examined the relationship between ipv perpetration, risk taking, and ed utilization among men in the general u.s. population. methods this cross sectional study utilized data from the national survey on drug use and health, focusing on non hispanic white, non hispanic black, and hispanic male respondents to years of age cohabiting with a spouse or partner. logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aor) and 95% confidence intervals (ci). results approximately 38% of ipv perpetrators reported ed use in the previous year compared to 24% of nonperpetrators. several risk taking factors (e.g. perception of risk taking, transportation related risk taking, aggression related arrest), alcohol and illicit drug use and abuse or dependence, and serious mental illness were positively associated with ipv perpetration. men reporting ipv were 1.5 times (aor 1.47, ci 1.012.13) more likely than nonperpetrators to utilize the ed, after taking all factors into account. drug abuse or dependence, transportation related risk behaviors, and serious mental illness also were independently associated with ed use. conclusions the results indicate that men who perpetrate ipv are more likely than nonperpetrators to use ed services. these findings suggest that screening for ipv, as well as risk taking and mental illness, among men accessing ed services may increase opportunities for intervention and referral.",0.5378151260504203,0.27426160337552746,0.39080111442461507
"Cognitive reserve has been proposed as an important etiologic factor in the development and severity of neuropsychiatric disorders . The construct of cognitive reserve refers to individual differences in brain structure (e.g., density of neuronal synapses) and function (e.g., processing efficiency) thought to buffer the effects of neuropathology. Evidence has emerged from the rapidly evolving field of cognitive epidemiology showing that IQ, a marker of cognitive reserve, is inversely related to risk of total psychiatric illness .Childhood IQ and Adult Mental Disorders: A Test of the Cognitive Reserve Hypothesis 19047325 This study has four main limitations. First, since persistence was based on a cumulative count of diagnoses, each of which was ascertained in a past year assessment at ages 18, 21, 26, and 32, gaps between our past year assessments may have led us to undercount some cohort members' episodes of disorder. However, with this prospective approach, disorders are not undercounted because of participants' failure to recall criterion symptoms from years past, as occurs in retrospective surveys .Our findings are consistent with the theory that lower cognitive reserve, as operationalized by childhood IQ, is a risk factor for major depression and certain anxiety disorders, with greater comorbidity and persistence of disorder. The mechanism through which low childhood IQ might confer these risks is unknown. We posit four mechanisms that warrant research.",PMC2705657.json,"objective cognitive reserve has been proposed as important in the etiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. however, tests of the association between premorbid iq and adult mental disorders other than schizophrenia have been limited and inconclusive. the authors tested the hypothesis that low childhood iq is associated with increased risk and severity of adult mental disorders. method participants were members of a representative 1972 1973 birth cohort of 1,037 males and females in dunedin, new zealand, who were followed up to age with 96% retention. wisc r iq was assessed at ages 7, 9, and 11. research diagnoses of dsm mental disorders were made at ages 18, 21, 26, and 32. results lower childhood iq was associated with increased risk of developing schizophrenia spectrum disorder, adult depression, and adult anxiety. lower childhood iq was also associated with greater comorbidity and with persistence of depression; the association with persistence of generalized anxiety disorder was nearly significant. higher childhood iq predicted increased risk of adult mania. conclusions lower cognitive reserve, as reflected by childhood iq, is an antecedent of several common psychiatric disorders and also predicts persistence and comorbidity. thus, many patients who seek mental health treatment may have lower cognitive ability; this should be considered in prevention and treatment planning.",0.45581395348837206,0.19158878504672897,0.3162239273664647
"Recent evolutionary theory seeks to understand how cues from ancestors, parentsand personal experience are integrated together to produce adaptive phenotypes. The central problem is that organisms in natural populationsmust decide how and whether to attend to cues from different sources, and those sourcesmight not always agree with each other. For example, an animal might obtain cues fromtheir father that the environment is safe, while personal experience suggests otherwise.Recent theory identifies the conditions that favour the evolution of reliance on somesources of cues over others, and highlights the importance of cuereliability during cue integration.Once fry were approximately one cm in length (at around one month ofage), each full sibling family was evenly divided into two separate tanks andrandomly assigned to either unexposed orpredator exposed treatments. Offspring were fed newly hatchedArtemia nauplii shrimp in excess each day until theyreached three cm in length, at which time they were fed the adult slurry offrozen food . At two months of age, juveniles in the predator exposed treatment werebriefly exposed to risk once a day for seven days.When fathers were exposed to predation risk while they were caring foroffspring, they decreased parental behaviour (, consistent with[, , ]).This behavioural shift suggests that fathers can provide cues to their offspringthrough their behavioural interaction with them, similar to the way that motheringinfluences the behavioural development of offspring in mammals. Juvenile offspring of predator exposedfathers were relatively small, had lower mass for a given length, and took more timeto emerge from a refuge compared to juvenile offspring of unexposed fathers , consistent with a previous study onsticklebacks, and withother studies on both evolved and developmental response to risk in smallfishes. It is possible that offspring ofpredator exposed fathers had these phenotypes because they received less fanning(oxygen) from their fathers, which caused altered growth patterns during embryonicdevelopment.",PMC6062471.json,"summary organisms can gain information about their environment from their ancestors, their parents, or their own personal experience. cue integration models often start with the simplifying assumption that information from different sources is additive. here, we test key assumptions and predictions of cue integration theory at both the phenotypic and molecular level in threespined sticklebacks (gasterosteus aculeatus). we show that regardless of whether cues about predation risk were provided by their father or acquired through personal experience, sticklebacks produced the same set of predator adapted phenotypes. moreover, there were nonadditive effects of personal and paternal experience: animals that received cues from both sources resembled animals that received cues from a single source. a similar pattern was detected at the molecular level: there was a core set of genes that were differentially expressed in the brains of offspring regardless of whether risk was experienced by their father, themselves or both. these results provide strong support for cue integration theory because they show that cues provided by parents and personal experience are comparable at both the phenotypic and molecular level, and draw attention to the importance of nonadditive responses to multiple cues.",0.39263803680981596,0.09034907597535935,0.21735616909405955
"Tractography is an important and unique tool for the non invasive, in vivo study of brain connections . With the emergence of modern and comprehensive diffusion MRI (dMRI) acquisition protocols, we can now map the human brain connections at an unprecedented resolution .

"The advancement of NMR instrumentation and methodology has made solution NMR spectroscopy an increasingly powerful tool for the investigation of protein structure and dynamics under physiological conditions and for studies of ligand binding and reaction mechanisms in solution. However, the inherent sensitivity limitation of NMR requires protein samples to be stable at high concentrations (> 100 M for structural studies) for an extended period (typically over a couple of days). Unfortunately, an estimated 75% of soluble proteins and many biologically important macromolecules are characterized by low solubility and instability .Overcoming the Solubility Limit with Solubility Enhancement Tags: Successful Applications in Biomolecular NMR Studies 19731047 Despite the success of the SET approach, it still brings a sizeable amount of extra signals from the protein tag. For a target protein of 1020 kDa, inclusion of a small GB1 tag (56 residues) easily adds about a quarter to a half of extra signals to those from the untagged protein. Although the excellent signal dispersion and the lack of resonance perturbation make the tag signals easy to identify, they nevertheless bring extra burden and complexity for resonance assignment .The preparation of highly soluble and stable samples represents a significant challenge for solution NMR studies of proteins with inherent poor solubility and stability.

"Programmed death ligand 1 (PDL1) is a major immunological checkpoint ligand molecule, and it is up regulated in tumors and tumor microenvironments of different types of cancer [ ]. Clinical trials report that the inhibition of PDL1 interaction with programmed cell death receptors (PD1), expressing on various types of immune cells (including antigen presenting cells, effector T cells, natural killer cells (NK), thymocytes, myeloid cells), leads to durable tumor control by the immune system and the suppression of different types of cancer [ ]. At least twenty seven clinical trials were initiated to evaluate PDL1/PD1 inhibitors alone or in combination with other drugs for the treatment of brain tumors (including gliomas and GBM) during 2014 2017 period: NCT02550249 (2015), NCT02423343 (2015), NCT02017717 (2014), NCT02311920 (2015), NCT02337491 (2015), NCT023311582 (2015), NCT01952769 (2014), NCT02336165 (2015), NCT01375842 (2011), NCT02829931 (2016), NCT02313272 (2014), NCT02798406 (2016), NCT03058289 (2017), NCT02335918 (2015), NCT02852655 (2016), NCT02526017 (2015), NCT03233152 (2017), NCT02968940 (2016), NCT02327078 (2014), NCT02794883 (2016), NCT02311582 (2014), NCT02937844 (2016), NCT02866747 (2016), NCT02336165 (2015), NCT02337491 (2015), NCT03014804 (2017), NCT02550249 (2015).The preclinical data generated in the orthotopic glioma mice models suggests that combination treatment with PD1/PDL1 inhibitors and radiotherapy, natural killer cells, bevacizumab, and small molecule inhibitors of apoptosis antagonists (SMCs) can successfully inhibit the tumors .The U251 cell line was purchased from Sigma (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).

"Tissue regeneration occurs through a complex sequence of events, which require the presence of various molecules or proteins at different times .

"Neurons in primary visual cortex (area V1) receive input from the thalamus and from an extensive network of lateral connections. The relative strength of these two signals remains controversial. One view holds that the responses of V1 neurons are largely determined by local processing of thalamic inputs , whereas another view states that V1 responses are substantially shaped by long range lateral connections .None To further test the causal relationship between spikes and LFP waves, we asked whether the LFP signal at one site could be predicted from spiking at remote locations. This is a demanding test, as the LFP in the absence of a stimulus is a highly variable signal and, to the best of our knowledge, no computational model has succeeded in predicting it quantitatively . We found that the waveform of the LFP signal measured during spontaneous activity can in fact be well predicted given knowledge of the individual spike times across the array .We recorded spike activity and LFPs across 10  10 arrays of electrodes that were implanted in primary visual cortex of anesthetized monkeys (area 17) and cats (area 18). Previously, we established that the LFP represents a measure of local postsynaptic activity in a 250 m radius of the recording site.

"It has long been recognized that differences from one cell to the next can arise through variation in the extracellular environment (e.g. morphogen gradients during embryogenesis) or from genomic alteration (e.g. genetic heterogeneity within a tumor). Only recently has it become clear that intracellular biochemical fluctuations can also have profound effects on phenotype. These fluctuations cause genetically identical cells to vary significantly in their responsiveness to stimuli and drugs even in a uniform environment [,,,,,,,].Non genetic cell to cell variability and the consequences for pharmacology 19833543 Linking protein expression levels to phenotype is most commonly performed using fixed and live cell microscopy. Only a limited number of cellular events are visible using bright field or phase contrast illumination (e.g. changes in cell size, morphology, motility, cell division) and fluorescent biosensors are needed to assay specific biochemical processes. Cell permeable dyes, such as JC 1 used to measure changes in mitochondrial membrane potential during apoptosis, can simply be added to cell growth media, while genetically encoded reporters have to be actively inserted into cells.The complexity of cellular response to drugs suggests that it will be valuable to study pre clinical pharmacology using sophisticated single cell measurement of both mean behaviors and variation about the mean in proteome and phenotype. While the phenomena of stochastic gene expression, proteome fluctuations and cell to cell variability in phenotypes have clearly been established in the context of single celled organisms and cell lines, the full impact on pharmacology and the treatment of human disease is currently unknown.

"Aptamers are oligonucleotides that can bind tightly and specifically to various molecular targets ranging from proteins to small molecules. Aptamers are usually isolated from combinatorial oligonucleotide libraries by the SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment) process, but natural aptamers also exist. In terms of the affinity and specificity to the molecular target, aptamers are comparable to antibodies.To demonstrate the feasibility, the design strategy was first applied to detect thrombin, a key serine protease that has been linked to the prevalent diseases including cardiovascular diseases and cancers. Generally speaking, detection with a low affinity recognition element tends to be more difficult than that with a high affinity recognition element. However, in order to examine whether our design strategy works for the more challenging cases, we purposely chose the 15nt anti thrombin DNA aptamer, whose affinity is 20~50 fold lower than that of another anti thrombin DNA aptamer.We developed a generic design strategy to detect non nucleic acid targets with an unmodified aptamer and a fluorogenic competitor, which was partially complementary to the aptamer. First of all, compared to most of design strategies where extensive optimization is necessary to preserve the affinity and specificity of the modified aptamer, elimination of modification on aptamers greatly simplifies the implementation of the design strategy. This has been demonstrated with different types of non nucleic acid targets (small molecules and proteins), but also with different types of aptamers (DNA and RNA).",PMC2885824.json,"aptamers are oligonucleotides that can bind to various non nucleic acid targets, ranging from proteins to small molecules, with a specificity and affinity comparable to that of antibodies. most aptamer based detection strategies require modification on the aptamer, which could lead to a significant loss in its affinity and specificity to the target. here we reported a generic strategy to design aptamer based optical probes. an unmodified aptamer specific to the target and a fluorogenic competitor complementary to the aptamer are utilized for target recognition and signal generation, respectively. the competitor is a hairpin oligonucleotide with a fluorophore attached on one end and a quencher attached on the other. when no target is present, the competitor binds to the aptamer. however, when the target is introduced, the competitor will be displaced from the aptamer by the target, thus resulting in a target specific decrease in fluorescence signal. successful application of this strategy to different types of targets (small molecules and proteins) as well as different types of aptamers (dna and rna) has been demonstrated. furthermore, a thermodynamics based prediction model was established to further rationalize the optimization process. due to its rapidness and simplicity, this aptamer based detection strategy holds great promise in high throughput applications.",0.569506726457399,0.23423423423423426,0.35810957473940347

"The protein turnover theory of aging posits that an increase in the number of damaged proteins with age leads to decreased protein turnover and is thought to be a major mechanism underlying senescence during aging. By some estimations protein damage in older individuals is at minimum 20% and may be as high as 50% of total protein and this damage is accompanied by a decrease in protein turnover of 2080% compared to younger controls . The ability to maintain functional proteins has been termed proteostasis and is thought to be key to the aging process.Statistical analysis was performed using PRISM v4.0c (GraphPad Software Inc, La Jolla CA). Differences between treatment (AL and CR) and age (young, middle, old) were compared using a two way analysis of variance (ANOVA). When a significant difference was detected, post hoc analysis was performed with Bonferroni's Multiple Comparison Test.It has been hypothesized that one of the lifespan extension effects of CR is an increase in mitochondrial biogenesis.

"Recent research has shown that spontaneous gestures during conversation can affect language processing in listeners. Hubbard et al. found greater blood oxygen level dependent activation in brain regions implicated in speech perception, such as higher order auditory cortex (left STG/S) and right planum temporale when listeners were presented with speech accompanied by rhythmic, nonsemantic gestures (so called beats) versus nonsense movements. Semantic gestures (iconics) have also been shown to affect the comprehension of speech [].One hundred and seventy five discourse primes (168 experimental, 7 practice) were derived from segments of continuous video recorded conversation in which a speaker described everyday experiences to an off camera interlocutor (see , , and , http://links.lww.com/WNR/A40, http://links.lww.com/WNR/A41, and http://links.lww.com/WNR/A42). On an average, the speaker produced 1.7 (SD=0.77) gestures per trial. Roughly half of the trials contained only one gesture; additional gestures were used primarily to elaborate information established by the first one.Iconic gestures modulated how accompanying speech was processed. When gesture information was available, content words elicited less negative ERPs relative to when gestures were absent. The time course and scalp distribution of this effect are consistent with those of the classic N400 effect, in which the amplitude of a negative component peaking around 400ms poststimulus is inversely correlated with the degree of fit between a meaningful stimulus and its context.",PMC2929818.json,"electroencephalogram was recorded as healthy adults viewed short videos of spontaneous discourse in which a speaker used depictive gestures to complement information expressed through speech. event related potentials were computed time locked to content words in the speech stream and to subsequent related and unrelated picture probes. gestures modulated event related potentials to content words co timed with the first gesture in a discourse segment, relative to the same words presented with static freeze frames of the speaker. effects were observed 200550ms after speech onset, a time interval associated with semantic processing. gestures also increased sensitivity to picture probe relatedness. effects of gestures on picture probe and spoken word analysis were inversely correlated, suggesting that gestures differentially impact verbal and image based processes.",0.36414565826330536,0.06760563380281691,0.20219350356161234
"Due to their unique optical properties, Au based nanostructures have received considerable attention in biomedical applications as both diagnostic contrast agents and therapeutic agents. Gold based nanostructures can interact with incident light and give rise to a strong extinction peak in the visible and near infrared (NIR) regions.

"Understanding the factors that influence risky driving among young drivers has been the focus of traffic safety researchers for decades. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), in 2008, 23% of all traffic fatalities in the United States involved individuals between 16 and 24 years of age . In addition, 37% of male drivers under the age of 25 who were involved in fatal crashes were speeding at the time of the crash.We found two studies that assessed a subscale that loaded onto the Perseverance factor and relevant driving outcomes; both studies used the SSS Disinhibition subscale . It is important to note that factor analysis showed that this subscale loaded on both Perseverance and Sensation Seeking factors. In a sample of American college students, found SSS Disinhibition to be positively correlated with risky driving (e.g., passing unsafely, ) and aggressive driving (e.g., making an angry gesture at another driver), but it was not significantly correlated with other driving outcomes (moving violations, losses of concentration while driving, losses of vehicular control, close calls, minor accidents, and major accidents).Although no published study has applied the five factor model of impulsivity like traits to driving, one study reviewed above included multiple facets of impulsivity that presumably measure four of the five impulsivity like traits. In their final model predicting ordinary driving violations, found that both the SSS Disinhibition subscale (indicator of low Perseverance/high Sensation Seeking) and BIS Nonplanning subscale (indicator of low Premeditation) were significant predictors of driving violations when controlling for each other, sensitivity to reward, and driving experience.

"Emotions are rooted in ancient cortico limbic survival circuits that generate behavioral dispositions in response to appetitive and aversive exteroceptive signals . In humans, exposure to affectively arousing stimuli triggers activity in multiple brain regions that coalesce into large scale functional assemblies . The amygdala and mPFC are thought to form communication hubs within these assemblies , owing to their dense interconnectivity with many regions of the brain supporting perceptual motor processing and behavioral control .27453345 The fMRI data were preprocessed using SPM5 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/). The first five volumes in each experimental session were discarded to eliminate transient effects. Slice timing was corrected using interpolation to account for differences in slice acquisition time.Taken together, the present data converge with animal and human findings , to demonstrate that appetitive and aversive stimulus processing are associated with heightened coupling between core affective structures and an array of brain areas associated with sensory and motor processing as well as executive control . In line with motivational and evolutionary theories of affect, emotion networks in the brain may link perceptual features reliably paired with threat or reward to support attentive behavior and ultimately mediate the preparation of the organism for goal oriented adaptive action. Although the networks emerging in response to different emotional challenges share individual components, the specific nature of motive system engagement is reflected in the distinct forms of functional coupling of varying structures into large scale brain networks .",PMC5061617.json,"it has been hypothesized that the medial prefrontal cortex (mpfc) is a hub in the network that mediates appetitive responses whereas the amygdala is thought to mediate both aversive and appetitive processing. both structures may facilitate adaptive responses to emotional challenge by linking perception, attention, memory, and motor circuits. we provide an initial exploration of these hypotheses by recording simultaneous eeg fmri in eleven participants viewing affective pictures. mpfc and amygdala seeded functional connectivity maps were generated by applying the beta series correlation method. the mpfc seeded correlation map encompassed visual regions, sensorimotor areas, prefrontal cortex, and medial temporal lobe structures, exclusively for pleasant content. for the amygdala seeded correlation map, a similar set of distributed brain areas appeared in the unpleasant neutral contrast, with the addition of such subcortical structures as insula and thalamus. a substantially sparser network was recruited for the pleasant neutral contrast. using the late positive potential (lpp) to index the intensity of emotional engagement, functional connectivity was found to be stronger in trials with larger lpp. these results demonstrate that mpfc mediated functional interactions are engaged specifically during appetitive processing, whereas the amygdala is coupled to distinct sets of brain regions during both aversive and appetitive processing. the strength of these interactions varies as a function of the intensity of emotional engagement.",0.41666666666666663,0.06167400881057268,0.22470403178291598

"Early studies of transplanted tissues have established that most millimeter sized grafts require perfusion with blood within 34 days to survive []. Inosculation between microvessels of the host and those in the implanted tissue led to timely reperfusion of the graft; in growth of host vessels also contributed to viability of a graft, depending on the source of tissue. Given the central importance of rapid establishment of perfusion in obtaining a viable graft, we and others have attempted to engineer pre vascularized constructs that could potentially accelerate (re)perfusion upon transplantation [].To distinguish the effects of shear stress and radial strain on vascular phenotype, we formed vessels in two new configurations: tapered vessels and vessels that were parallel with bare channels . In tapered microvessels, the upstream segments were wider than the downstream ones. Since the same flow passed through both segments, much lower shears existed upstream than downstream.This work reports the effect of the mechanical microenvironment on the barrier properties and stability of engineered microvessels in microfluidic collagen gels. We found that increased flow led to stronger barrier function and greater stability via increases in shear stress and radial strain (or transmural pressure), respectively.

"Cerebellar Purkinje cells of the rat are especially vulnerable to developmental ethanol exposure on postnatal days (PN) 46, with the amount of neuronal loss directly proportional to the blood ethanol concentration (, , , , ). At PN4 6, the rat brain is in a period of rapid growth similar to human brain development found during the third trimester (, , ).

When a higher ethanol exposure was utilized (50% increase in BEC), the magnitude of Purkinje neuron apoptotic loss was not increased; however, the neurons that survived this higher exposure showed a significant decrease in climbing fiber innervation from the inferior olive that remains temporally concordant with the ethanol induced apoptosis. This decrease is evidenced by a reduction in the total developing climbing fiber terminal innervation and a reduction in the actual innervating contacts as measured by the co localization of VGluT2 and CalB.",PMC2914222.json,"ethanol exposure during postnatal days (pn) 4 6 in rats alters cerebellar development resulting in significant loss of purkinje cells. there is little knowledge, however, on what happens to the neurons that survive. in this study, rat pups were treated with a daily dose of ethanol (either 3.6 or 4.5 g/kg body weight) delivered by intragastric intubation on pn4, pn4 6, or pn7 9. then the interactions between climbing fibers and purkinje cell were examined on pn14 using confocal microscopy. mid vermal cerebellar sections were stained with antibodies to calbindin d28k (to visualize purkinje cells) and vesicular glutamate transporter (vglut2, to visualize climbing fibers). confocal z stack images were obtained from lobule and analyzed with imaris software to quantify the staining of the two antibodies. the vglut2 immunostaining was significantly reduced in the pn4 and pn4 6 ethanol groups for the 4.5 g/kg dose level, compared to controls, indicating that the cerebellar circuitry was significantly altered following developmental ethanol exposure. not only were there fewer purkinje cells following ethanol exposure, but the surviving neurons had significantly fewer vglut2 labeled synapses. these alterations in the synaptic integrity were both dose dependent and temporally dependent.",0.39215686274509803,0.1137855579868709,0.22863308786782915
"Various studies have documented that the classical risk factors for coronary artery disease, including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cholesterol, and obesity, are increasing in the developing world.

Pharmacologic treatment of the various co morbidities would also influence these biomarkers, and we do not have sufficient information on medication use in Ibadan.Biomeasures associated with cardiovascular disease risk differ between these two cohorts.

"The mRNA levels and function are known to be controlled by several factors including transcription factors, histones, DNA methylation, and RNases. In addition, recent studies indicated that mRNAs are finely controlled by a group of small noncoding, evolutionarily conserved RNAs of ~22 nucleotides (nt) long called microRNAs (miRNAs) (; ; ; ; ). Although their mechanism of action is not completely elucidated, miRNAs are thought to modulate mRNA function by binding to an 8 base pair complementary seed region in the 3UTR.A 1 h transient MCAO in adult rats resulted in significant neuronal damage and infarction in the ipsilateral cortex and striatum that progressed with the time of reperfusion from 3 h to 3 days . Microscopic examination of the Cresyl violet stained brain sections showed a progressive loss of pyramidal neurons in the ipsilateral cortex between 6 h and 1 day of reperfusion . These observations were similar to our previous studies  .In brief, the results of the present study showed that transient focal ischemia induces an extensive temporal change in the cerebral miRNAome but has no effect on miRNA synthetic machinery.

"The most conspicuous and extensively studied behavior of anuran amphibians (frogs and toads) is their acoustic communication. In the vast majority of anurans, vocal signaling mediates sexual behavior: sexually active males produce courtship calls to attract females. In these species the tie between vocal communication and reproduction is unambiguous .There are two hormonal systems that are widely recognized to influence reproductive behaviors, including acoustic communication, in anurans. The first is a neuromodulator system comprised of arginine vasotocin (AVT), a peptide hormone produced by neurons in the telencephalon and diencephalon. The second is an endocrine system consisting of the suite of steroid hormones (e.g., testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, estrogen) produced by the gonads and regulated by a signaling cascade beginning with another neuropeptide produced in the basal forebrain, gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH).Hormones play a vital role in regulating the sexual behavior of vertebrates, from frogs to humans, and hormonal systems are highly conserved across vertebrate taxa. Acoustic communication is the primary mediator of sexual behavior in the majority of anuran species, thus it provides an excellent system within which to explore the diversity of ways in which hormones work to ensure appropriate and successful reproductive activity. To coordinate breeding, both signalers and receivers are under selection to produce appropriate and temporally coordinated behaviors during the reproductive season.",PMC2722832.json,"the majority of anuran amphibians (frogs and toads) use acoustic communication to mediate sexual behavior and reproduction. generally, females find and select their mates using acoustic cues provided by males in the form of conspicuous advertisement calls. in these species, vocal signal production and reception are intimately tied to successful reproduction. research with anurans has demonstrated that acoustic communication is modulated by reproductive hormones, including gonadal steroids and peptide neuromodulators. most of these studies have focused on the ways in which hormonal systems influence vocal signal production; however, here we will concentrate on a growing body of literature that examines hormonal modulation of call reception. this literature suggests that reproductive hormones contribute to the coordination of reproductive behaviors between signaler and receiver by modulating sensitivity and spectral filtering of the anuran auditory system. it has become evident that the hormonal systems that influence reproductive behaviors are highly conserved among vertebrate taxa, thus studying the endocrine and neuromodulatory bases of acoustic communication in frogs and toads can lead to insights of broader applicability to hormonal modulation of vertebrate sensory physiology and behavior.",0.5541561712846348,0.17215189873417722,0.33291318147064347
"During early post natal life, ocular growth is modulated by the visual input from the retina, resulting in the correction of refractive errors (reviewed by refs. ). Eyes use two compensatory mechanisms to reduce defocus: When the eye wears a positive lens, which would put the images of distant objects in front of the photoreceptors (myopic defocus), it slows its rate of elongation and thickens the choroid, pushing the retina forward toward the image plane. When the eye wears a negative lens, which would put the images of distant objects behind the photoreceptors (hyperopic defocus), it accelerates its rate of elongation and thins the choroid, pulling the retina back toward the image plane.Because the chicks in this study were kept in darkness for much of the time, we need to discuss whether the darkness vitiates our results. To be sure, the ideal way to assess the temporal characteristics of the lens wear would be to keep the birds between episodes in a neutral condition that had no influence on the ocular parameters. Unfortunately, darkness is the condition closest to neutral that we are aware of.Our results are consistent with the existence of emmetropization signals that increase to saturation during episodes of defocus and then decline between episodes. Furthermore, there seem to be separate signals for the ocular elongation and choroidal components of lens compensation, as well as differences between positive and negative lenses, suggestive of separate signals for myopic and hyperopic defocus. The signals regulating the rate of ocular elongation and choroidal thickness with both positive and negative lens wear rise at a similar rate (1 to 4 min required to increase it by 50%), and fall at drastically different rates: The signal for inhibition of ocular elongation by positive lens wear is the most enduring (a 24.4 hr dark interval is required for a 50% decrease), and the signal for acceleration of ocular elongation by negative lens wear is the most transient (only a 0.4 hr dark interval is required for a 50% decrease); the signals controlling choroidal thickness are intermediate .",PMC2761084.json,"purpose chicks eyes rapidly compensate for defocus imposed by spectacle lenses by changing their rate of elongation and their choroidal thickness. we hypothesize that defocus causes internal emmetropization signals to rise and become saturated during episodes of lens wear and to decline between episodes. we measured the time constants of these signals indirectly by measuring the magnitude of lens compensation in refractive error and ocular dimensions as a function of the duration of episodes and the interval between the episodes. methods first, to study how quickly the signals rose, we gave chicks episodes of lens wear of various durations (darkness otherwise) and estimated the duration required to cause a half maximal effect (rise time). second, to study how quickly the signals declined, we gave episodes of lens wear with various dark intervals in between and estimated the interval required to reduce the maximal effect by half (fall time). results the rise times for the rate of ocular elongation and choroidal thickness were approximately min for positive and negative lenses. the fall times had a broad range of time courses: positive lenses caused an enduring inhibition of ocular elongation with a fall time of hr. in contrast, negative lenses caused a transient stimulation of ocular elongation with a fall time of 0.4 hr. conclusions the effects of episodes of defocus rise rapidly with episode duration to an asymptote and decline between episodes with a time course that depends strongly on the sign of defocus and the ocular component. we suspect that the complex etiology of human myopia may reflect these temporal properties.",0.4942339373970346,0.15537190082644628,0.26653894141919093
"High blood pressure affects about one third of adults and contributes to 13.5 million deaths worldwide each year and about half the global risk for stroke and ischemic heart disease. Clinical trials, dating back more than forty years, have proven that drug treatment to lower blood pressure dramatically reduces the risk of cardiovascular events in people with hypertension. The substantial (30 60 percent) heritability of blood pressure has prompted extensive efforts to identify its genetic underpinnings.For imputation of genotypes to the HapMap set of approximately 2.5 million SNPs, ARIC, FHS, and RS used a Hidden Markov Model as implemented in MACH, and CHS used BIMBAM10 v0.99 .

The precise pathology underlying these neuroimaging abnormalities is not yet known, but could be related to one or more characteristics of white matter organization including axonal size, density, packing, water content, and myelination. Because these abnormalities appear to be related to cognitive functioning, they may be critical in understanding the origins of the common deficits seen in FASD, including visual perceptual abnormalities, attention and executive functioning deficits, and behavioral and emotional dysregulation.",PMC2895908.json,"background several studies have now shown corpus callosum abnormalities using diffusion tensor imaging (dti) in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (fasd) in comparison with nonexposed controls. the data suggest that posterior regions of the callosum may be disproportionately affected. the current study builds on previous efforts, including our own work, and moves beyond midline corpus callosum to probe major inter hemispheric white matter pathways with an improved dti tractographic method. this study also expands on our prior work by evaluating a larger sample and by incorporating children with a broader range of clinical effects including full criteria fetal alcohol syndrome (fas). methods participants included children with fasd (8 fas, partial fas, static encephalopathy) and nonexposed controls between the ages of and years. participants underwent dti scans and intelligence testing. groups (fasd vs. controls) were compared on fractional anisotropy (fa) and mean diffusivity (md) in white matter tracts projected through the corpus callosum. exploratory analyses were also conducted examining the relationships between dti measures in the corpus callosum and measures of intellectual functioning and facial dysmorphology. results in comparison with the control group, the fasd group had significantly lower fa in posterior tracts of the corpus callosum: the posterior mid body, the isthmus, and the splenium. a trend level finding also suggested lower fa in the genu. measures of white matter integrity and cognition were correlated and suggest some regional specificity, in that only posterior regions of the corpus callosum were associated with visual perceptual skills. correlations between measures of facial dysmorphology and posterior regions of the corpus callosum were nonsignificant. conclusions consistent with previous dti studies, these results suggest that microstructural posterior corpus callosum abnormalities are present in children with prenatal alcohol exposure and cognitive impairment. these abnormalities are clinically relevant because they are associated with cognitive deficits and appear to provide evidence of abnormalities associated with prenatal alcohol exposure independent of dysmorphic features. as such, they may yield important diagnostic and prognostic information not provided by the traditional facial characteristics.",0.3466135458167331,0.096,0.2225786367443239

"We have previously reported a neuroprotective role of sodium pyruvate (SP) treatment in a rat model of cortical contusion injury (CCI) . In those studies a single SP injection (1000 mg/kg, i.p.) within 5 min after CCI was found to significantly increase the brain's extracellular concentration of pyruvate, attenuating the CCI induced decrease in extracellular glucose and increase in extracellular lactate . A single SP treatment was also found to significantly reduce the numbers of dead/dying neurons in the peri contusional cortex at 6 h post CCI.Forty two adult (65 85 days old at the time of surgery) male Sprague Dawley rats were used to determine the effects of SP or EP on cell death, metabolism and microglia activation at 72 h post injury in Experiment 1. The average body weights on the day of surgery did not differ between groups (lowest = 326  12 g; highest = 347  13 g).In the past decade there has been increasing evidence for a therapeutic role of pyruvate in neurological disorders.

While neuroprotection afforded by 500 or 1000 mg/kg of SP at 6 h did not differ significantly the higher dose was slightly more effective, thus 1000 mg/kg of SP was administered at 5, 65 and 125 min post injury and found to significantly reduce cortical tissue loss at two weeks.",PMC2939141.json,"sodium pyruvate (sp) treatment initiated within min post injury is neuroprotective in a rat model of unilateral cortical contusion injury (cci). the current studies examined: (1) effects of delayed sp treatments (1000 mg/kg, i.p., at 1, and h), (2) effects of single (1 h) or multiple (1, and h) ethyl pyruvate treatments (ep; at or mg/kg, i.p.), and (3) mechanisms of action for pyruvate effects after cci. in experiment 1, both sp and ep treatment(s) significantly reduced the number of dead/dying cells in the ipsilateral hippocampus (dentate hilus+ca3c and/or ca3a b regions) at h post cci. pyruvate treatment(s) attenuated cci induced reductions of cerebral cytochrome oxidase activity at h, significantly improving activity in peri contusional cortex after multiple sp or ep treatments. optical density measures of ipsilateral cd11b immuno staining were significantly increased h post cci, but these measures of microglia activation were not different from sham injury values in sp and ep groups with three post cci treatments. in experiment 2, three treatments (1, and h) of sp (1000 mg/kg) or ep (40 mg/kg) significantly improved recovery of beam walking and neurological scores in the first three weeks after cci, and ep treatments significantly improved spatial working memory one week post cci. ipsilateral ca3b neuronal loss, but not cortical tissue loss, was significantly reduced one month post cci with pyruvate treatments begun h post cci. thus, delayed pyruvate treatments after cci are neuroprotective and improve neurobehavioral recovery; these effects may be mediated by improved metabolism and reduced inflammation.",0.5,0.20216606498194947,0.33198286715042463

"A Critically important aspect of imaging science is the problem of evaluating image quality , which is a necessary ingredient for optimization of imaging systems and image processing algorithms. In the early days of image processing, it was common to use simple numerical criteria, such as signal to noise ratio, to assess image quality in the presence of blur, noise, and other artifacts. However, it is now widely accepted that the quality of an image must ultimately be defined by the degree to which the image serves its intended purpose.The CHO is a numerical observer that serves as a surrogate for human observers in evaluations of image quality. In this context, one considers an image to be of good quality if it permits the numerical observer to perform well in detecting a known signal (e.g., a lesion) . Suppose that an observed image is represented as a vector f by using lexicographic ordering of the pixel values.We have introduced an alternative to the CHO called the channelized support vector machine (CSVM) (as well as the channelized linear regression model (CLIN) a special case of CSVM when a first order polynomial kernel is used for SVM), which is intended for use as a task based measure of image quality. We found, at least for the data tested, that the CSVM, obtained by regressing against the human observer scores, can produce more accurate predictions of human observer performance than the CHO. Our main finding is that, while the CHO and CSVM both generalized well to unseen images reconstructed in the same way as those in the training set, the CHO did not generalize well in this experiment to unseen images reconstructed in different ways.",PMC2826509.json,"it is now widely accepted that image quality should be evaluated using task based criteria, such as human observer performance in a lesion detection task. the channelized hotelling observer (cho) has been widely used as a surrogate for human observers in evaluating lesion detectability. in this paper, we propose that the problem of developing a numerical observer can be viewed as a system identification or supervised learning problem, in which the goal is to identify the unknown system of the human observer. following this approach, we explore the possibility of replacing the hotelling detector within the cho with an algorithm that learns the relationship between measured channel features and human observer scores. specifically, we develop a channelized support vector machine (csvm) which we compare to the cho in terms of its ability to predict human observer performance. in the examples studied, we find that the csvm is better able to generalize to unseen images than the cho, and therefore may represent a useful improvement on the cho methodology, while retaining its essential features.",0.5,0.2158590308370044,0.30699921482901255

In these approaches, magnification of the projected image onto a detector of modest intrinsic spatial resolution (~1 3 mm) is used to obtain high spatial resolution in the reconstructed images (<1.5 mm) .Multi pinhole SPECT Imaging with Silicon Strip Detectors 20953300 Because the maximum energy loss when a 27 keV photon undergoes a Compton scattering is 2.6 keV, the use of energy windowing to suppress scatter contribution to an image is of little use, particularly considering that there are several closely spaced emissions from 125I between 27 and 35 keV. The key factor is for the signal to noise to be sufficient that trigger thresholds can be set low enough to capture events even when charge is shared across strips when photons interact in the region between two strips . Using software provided by the manufacturer, a gain calibration was performed for all 640 p strips using an 241Am source.We have demonstrated the ability to perform tomographic reconstructions of multi pinhole data acquired at multiple magnifications using a silicon double sided strip detector of high spatial resolution. We have also explored the ability to reconstruct images using data from a small number of views using our prototype imaging system. We believe this approach is well suited for imaging applications requiring high spatial resolution over a small field of view, such as mouse brain imaging .",PMC2953820.json,"silicon double sided strip detectors offer outstanding instrinsic spatial resolution with reasonable detection efficiency for iodine 125 emissions. this spatial resolution allows for multiple pinhole imaging at low magnification, minimizing the problem of multiplexing. we have conducted imaging studies using a prototype system that utilizes a detector of 300 micrometer thickness and 50 micrometer strip pitch together with a 23 pinhole collimator. these studies include an investigation of the synthetic collimator imaging approach, which combines multiple pinhole projections acquired at multiple magnifications to obtain tomographic reconstructions from limited angle data using the ml em algorithm. sub millimeter spatial resolution was obtained, demonstrating the basic validity of this approach.",0.32098765432098764,0.09925558312655088,0.2069528137772977

"Detection of hepatic metastases at abdominopelvic CT is a challenging diagnostic task because of the small CT number differences between a metastasis and the surrounding hepatic parenchyma, which is referred to as a low contrast detection task, referring to the detectability of low contrast lesions compared with their anatomic background. Whereas iterative reconstruction (IR) has been shown to improve image quality of lower dose abdominal CT images , its ability to improve observer performance for low contrast detection tasks such as detection of hepatic metastases (where similar attenuation can be observed between metastases and background liver) has proven limited in human observer studies (). With IR, spatial resolution is dependent on image contrast differences, so small lesions with ill defined borders may be obscured at lower doses or in large patients, both of which increase image noise .This radiologist reader study was approved by our institutional review board and was Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliant.

The role of the Nramp1 gene in innate immunity was originally identified because a mutation in Nramp1 occurring in common mouse strains conferred susceptibility to infection with intracellular microbes that localize in macrophages, including Mycobacteria, Salmonella typhimurium and Leishmania donovanii. Although controversy about the specific mechanism still persists, it now appears that Nramp1 acts by depleting Fe2+, Co2+ and Mn2+ from the phagosome, and thereby starving the phagosomal microbes of these essential nutrients.The evidence is strong that iron restriction is an important component of innate immunity, and a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

"Improvements in health and health expectancies (the average lifetime in different health states) among the elderly have recently attracted the attention of researchers and policymakers as longevity continues to increase. However, there are questions about whether declines in morbidity and disability will accompany the declines in mortality (; ; ). Studies show that improvements in health among the elderly are not universal and that the patterns of change are partly attributable to the stage of the epidemiologic transition in a given country (e.g., ; ).Our analysis cannot address whether reductions in mortality are associated with the differential characteristics of the population. Therefore, we assume that each age sex specific individual experiences similar improvements in mortality from 1992 to 2002. Under this assumption, we examine how improvements in health status contribute to increases in health expectancies.The present study is unique because it investigates changing health and health expectancies using two large national datasets from China, a rapidly developing country with the worlds largest elderly population. The results showed that elderly men and women in China exhibited significant improvements in chronic disease and SRH from 1992 to 2002, although improvements in ADL functioning were not statistically significant. Health expectancies measured as ALE, DFLE, and HLE increased during this period and were patterned differently according to sex and changes in disease prevalence, mortality decline, and individual health assessments.",PMC2727476.json,"numerous studies document improvements in health status and health expectancies among older adults over time. however, most evidence is from developed nations and gender differences in health trends are often inconsistent. it remains unknown whether changes in health in developing countries resemble western trends or whether patterns of health improvement are unique to the countrys epidemiologic transition and gender norms. using two nationally representative samples of non institutionalized adults in china ages and older, this study investigates gender differences in the improvements in disability, chronic disease prevalence, and self rated health from to 2002. results from multivariate logistic regression models show that all three indicators of health improved over the 10 year period, with the largest improvement in self rated health. with the exception of disability, the health of women improved more than men. using sullivans decomposition methods, we also show that active life expectancy, disease free life expectancy, and healthy life expectancy increased over this decade and were patterned differently according to gender. overall, the findings demonstrate that china experienced broad health improvements during its early stages of the epidemiologic transition and that these changes were not uniform by gender. we discuss the public health implications of the findings in the context of chinas rapidly aging population.",0.5522041763341067,0.1585081585081585,0.30093471677528316

The standard erythema dose (SED) was developed as a means of addressing this issue; it is equal to an erythemal effective radiant exposure of 100 J/m2, which takes both irradiance and wavelength into account. As a point of reference for future discussion, it would take 4 SED to elicit erythema in previously unexposed fair skin .Various studies indicate that commonly used indoor lamps, including halogen, incandescent, and fluorescent emit appreciable levels of UVR.

"In recent years, twin studies have become increasingly popular in cognitive neuroscience and medical imaging as a means to determine genetic influences on brain structure and function, the ultimate goal being the discovery of specific genes that influence brain development and disease . To estimate the genetic and environmental contributions to a phenotype, several models have been established that compare correlations in monozygotic twins (MZs, who share 100 % of their genes) to those found between dizygotic twins (DZs, who share 50 % of their genes on average). One common measure is the ANOVA based (Pearson) intraclass correlation (ICC), which quantifies the resemblance within twin pairs.sMRI images were automatically skull stripped using the Brain Surface Extraction software (BSE) followed by manual editing. Each masked image was registered via 9 parameter linear transformation to a high resolution single participant brain template image, the Colin27 template, using the FLIRT software . Linearly registered sMRI images were then registered to a Mean Deformation Template (MDT; created from the dataset) using a 3D fluid registration .Here we demonstrated how to estimate the intraclass correlation using REML methods for multidimensional signals, and we applied the method to analyze DT images in a dataset of 100 twins.

"Combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) has had a significant impact on the course of HIV disease . With the decline of opportunistic infections, however, other conditions such as liver and kidney diseases have emerged as threats to the lives of people living with HIV (PLWH; ).

CD4 counts tended to be lower in participants with CKD. After controlling for hepatitis co infection, date of HIV diagnosis, and use of combination ART, Black Caribbeans had lower CD4 counts (81  12 cells/mm3) than African Americans (139.5  9.8, p = 0.002), Hispanics (171.8  25.9, p = 0.002), and Whites (162.8  37, p = 0.01).The present findings have a number of important clinical and public health implications. First, current guidelines recommend screening for CKD at the time of HIV diagnosis in all patients, with annual screening in individuals at increased risk for CKD .

"Health related information helps patients cope with illness by increasing knowledge, reducing feelings of uncertainty, and enhancing emotional and social adjustment . When seeking information, patients have a number of sources from which to choose, including health professionals like physicians [ ], pharmacists , and nurses [,,], health related websites , patient information leaflets , mass media sources such as newspapers, magazines, and television [,,], and family and friends [,,]. The opportunity to encounter conflicting information arises when health information is obtained from more than one source and may vary based on whether information is received passively (i.e. from two different physicians) or actively obtained by patients during information searches (i.e. Internet information contradicts physician recommendations) .Our study findings should be interpreted with caution for several reasons. First, patients tend to over report medication adherence on self reported questionnaires , which may be due to patients forgetting instances of non adherence as well as social desirability bias. However, this likely biased our result towards the null by weakening the relationship between conflicting information and adherence.Conflicting medication information is a clear threat to patient medication adherence. If vasculitis patients receive conflicting medication information, then it is almost certain that patients with more common diseases encounter just as much, if not more, conflicting information, especially from media sources and family and friends .

"Sociopolitical and sociodemographic factors differentiate waves of Cuban migration to the U.S. (; Bach et al, 1982; ; ; ; ; ). The health and adjustment implications of these factors may be far reaching (e.g., ; ; ). We investigate whether Cuban immigrants arriving during or subsequent to 1980 are disadvantaged in depression, anxiety, and self esteem relative to Cubans immigrating prior to 1980.We employ data from wave one of the Physical Challenge and Health study conducted in Miami Dade County, Florida and approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Florida International University and Florida State University.

"This article is based on the 2009 Pritzker Distinguished Award Lecture I presented to the Biomedical Engineering Society in the opening symposium of their annual meeting that was convened at Pittsburgh, PA in October 2009. My scientific education was limited to the fields of molecular biochemistry, cell biology and medicine, and I have never taken an academic course in engineering. Thus, virtually all of the contributions I have made in the field of bioengineering for which I am being honored today are based on what I have learned from my trainees, and from my many outstanding collaborators.From Cellular Mechanotransduction to Biologically Inspired Engineering 20140519 The bodys structural hierarchies enable it to channel mechanical forces applied at the organ level through load bearing prestressed networks of bones, muscles, tendons, fascia, and ECM scaffolds so that they impact cell and molecular structure at the nanometer scale. This is important because the cytoskeleton that gives cells their shape is more than a mechanical scaffold; it also orients most of the cells metabolic machinery. Many of the enzymes and substrates that mediate DNA synthesis, RNA processing, transcription, translation, glycolysis and signal transduction do not function in solution, or when floating free in the lipid bilayer.In this lecture, I tried to convey my path from science to engineering, and from fundamental mechanistic research to technology development and translation. I hope that I fully communicated the challenges I have faced as a biologist who believed that mechanics and structure are as important regulators of cell and tissue function as chemicals and genes. I had to seek out collaborators who shared in my vision and had the patience to teach me engineering principles, concepts, approaches, and vocabulary.",PMC2913424.json,"this article is based on a lecture i presented as the recipient of the pritzker distinguished lecturer award at the biomedical engineering society annual meeting in october 2009. here, i review more than thirty years of research from my laboratory, beginning with studies designed to test the theory that cells use tensegrity (tensional integrity) architecture to stabilize their shape and sense mechanical signals, which i believed to be critical for control of cell function and tissue development. although i was trained as a cell biologist, i found that the tools i had at my disposal were insufficient to experimentally test these theories, and thus i ventured into engineering to find critical solutions. this path has been extremely fruitful as it has led to confirmation of the critical role that physical forces play in developmental control, as well as how cells sense and respond to mechanical signals at the molecular level through a process known as cellular mechanotransduction. many of the predictions of the cellular tensegrity model relating to cell mechanical behaviors have been shown to be valid, and this vision of cell structure led to discovery of the central role that transmembrane adhesion receptors, such as integrins, and the cytoskeleton play in mechanosensing and mechanochemical conversion. in addition, these fundamental studies have led to significant unexpected technology fallout, including development of micromagnetic actuators for non invasive control of cellular signaling, microfluidic systems as therapeutic extracorporeal devices for sepsis therapy, and new dna based nanobiotechnology approaches that permit construction of artificial tensegrities that mimic properties of living materials for applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.",0.493601462522852,0.11376146788990826,0.2942265229809131

"Logical consistency across decisions, regardless of how choices are presented, is a central tenet of rational choice theory and the cornerstone of modern economic and political science . Empirical data challenge this perspective by showing that humans are highly susceptible to the manner or context in which options are cast, resulting in a decision bias termed the framing effect . We have previously shown that the amygdala mediates this framing bias, a finding that highlights the importance of incorporating emotional processes within models of human decision making .The experiment was divided into three parts: an instruction phase, a task phase during which subjects performed the task (during this phase SCR was recorded), and a questionnaire phase. In the instruction phase, subjects were familiarized with decision making task and given a number of practice trials before starting the main behavioral task . The task was divided into three 17 min sessions.In accordance with our previously reported findings, all control subjects manifest susceptibility to the framing effect, reflected in an increased disposition to gamble in loss compared with gain frames (mean, 14.24  1.68%). This susceptibility to the frame manipulation was markedly reduced in the ASD group (mean, 7.66  1.95%) . The significance of this effect was confirmed in an interaction analysis showing that the ASD subjects were significantly more consistent (i.e., less influenced by the frame) in their pattern of choice compared with controls [ANOVA; group (ASD, control)  frame (gain, loss); F(1,27) = 6.56, p < 0.02] .",PMC2682781.json,"the emotional responses elicited by the way options are framed often results in lack of logical consistency in human decision making. in this study, we investigated subjects with autism spectrum disorder (asd) using a financial task in which the monetary prospects were presented as either loss or gain. we report both behavioral evidence that asd subjects show a reduced susceptibility to the framing effect and psycho physiological evidence that they fail to incorporate emotional context into the decision making process. on this basis, we suggest that this insensitivity to contextual frame, although enhancing choice consistency in asd, may also underpin core deficits in this disorder. these data highlight both benefits and costs arising from multiple decision processes in human cognition.",0.3902439024390244,0.07629427792915532,0.23429567007095906

"It has long been recognized in breast cancer that the effect of hormone receptor (HR) status on recurrence is transient in nature . While HR negative patients initially have higher rates of recurrence, this difference diminishes over time.

"Growth and dissolution of crystals from aqueous solutions are ubiquitous phenomena in industrial, biological and environmental settings. Whether these processes occur through technological or natural processes, the effect of impurities is a central issue because they are often unavoidable constituents or intentionally added to control growth rate, crystal habit, or physical properties.

"The genomic DNA of bacteriophage phi29 translocates into a preformed protein shell (procapsid) during viral reproduction. This energetically unfavorable process is driven by an ATP powered DNA packaging motor. The motor has been studied extensively and reconstructed in vitro.The activity assay of pRNA via the in vitro phi29 assembly system was performed as reported previously. After pre incubation of pRNA with asDNA or rDNA molecules as indicated, pRNA or pRNA DNA complexes were incubated with viral procapsids, protein gp16, and the phi29 genomic DNA gp3 conjugate.

"Fluoride (F) determination in salt became relevant since salt fluoridation was proposed as an adequate vehicle for public fluoridation. This alternative to water fluoridation started to be successfully used in several countries throughout the world (; ; ; ). Because of safety and quality control issues, constant monitoring of salt F concentration has been recommended .The two basic methods used for F determination were: direct analysis, which is used for F analysis of samples that contain free, ionic fluorine. The second method was diffusion analysis, which releases both free and bound fluorine, subsequently concentrates it, and is used for samples in which fluorine may be in a covalent or complexed form. One research technician conducted analyses of all samples, while a second research technician conducted duplicate analysis in order to determine inter technician reproducibility.Results of a thorough assessment of analytical methods commonly used to analyze fluoridated salt which included several different combinations of methods indicated that the use of the diffusion method with no prior treatment of the samples showed higher recoveries of F for both diluted and undiluted samples. Increasing the proportion of TISAB or using different types of TISAB did not yield percentage recoveries as large as those obtained with diffusion.

"Responding to the dramatic increase in obesity and type 2 diabetes among children and adolescents, in 2002 the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of the National Institutes of Health sponsored a collaborative agreement to develop and conduct both a treatment and a prevention trial of type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents. After a series of pilot studies, the prevention arm of this effort culminated in the development and conduct of the HEALTHY primary prevention trial. Seven centers across the country recruited 42 middle schools, and half were randomly assigned to receive a multicomponent intervention.To minimize bias and maximize the quality of the process evaluation data, personnel responsible for collecting these data were rigorously trained and enjoined to maintain strict segregation from the intervention activities. Specifically, the research assistants (RAs) who collected the process evaluation data were prohibited from participating in any intervention implementation activities. In a multi year, labor intensive and complex trial such as the HEALTHY study, in which some communication between evaluators and implementation staff is necessary for the successful execution of the protocol, it is a constant challenge to foster the neutrality of process evaluation staff.The process evaluation methods and procedures used in the HEALTHY study combined qualitative and quantitative methods to document the intervention as it was delivered, identify areas where delivery was suboptimal or problematic, and contribute to the development of strategies to address barriers to and problems with delivery of the intervention components.

"Approximately 99% of the 4 million annual neonatal deaths occur in low and middle income countries, and 36% are attributed to serious infections; in high mortality settings this proportion may approach 50%. The overall proportion of mortality related to local umbilical cord infections that become systemic is unknown, but exposure to pathogens, with or without the development of local signs of omphalitis is thought to be an important proximal event in the pathway to sepsis and death in newborns. Observational data from Papua New Guinea indicated that probable sepsis and fever were 9.4 and 6.7 times less likely among newborns exposed to acriflavine spirit cord cleansing compared with unexposed historical controls.Risk of Mortality Subsequent to Umbilical Cord Infection Among Newborns of Southern Nepal 19034065 The analysis presented here is a nested case control study of data previously collected within a community based, cluster randomized trial of the impact of newborn skin and umbilical cord cleansing with chlorhexidine on neonatal morbidity and mortality, conducted by the Nepal Nutrition Intervention ProjectSarlahi (NNIPS). Details of the study population, recruitment, assessment of infection signs, and other procedures have been provided previously.  Briefly, infants were randomized within clusters to 1 of 2 full body wiping regimens (1 time wipe with either 0.25% chlorhexidine or placebo as soon as possible after birth) and 3 cord care regimens (umbilical stump cleansing with 4.0% chlorhexidine, cleansing with soap and water, or dry cord care only).The overall contribution to neonatal mortality because of the associated risk between local signs of cord infection and death is difficult to define, and likely varies substantially across communities. Entry of pathogens into the bloodstream to cause death of the neonate seems to occur either directly, in the absence of local signs of umbilical cord infection (for example, shortly after cutting the cord when the umbilical vessels are patent, and before local signs of infection have developed), or via invasion into the bloodstream at a later date from infected umbilical tissue. The data presented here, although not conclusive, provide supportive evidence for continued risk of mortality as a result of the second pathway (ie, subsequent to local cord infections progressing to systemic infections).",PMC2680481.json,"background neonatal sepsis may stem from local umbilical cord infections. signs of cord infection are common in low resource settings, yet the risk of mortality subsequent to these signs has not been quantified in either developed or developing countries. we compared the risk of mortality between infants with and without signs of umbilical cord infection during a community based trial of chlorhexidine interventions in southern nepal. methods newborns were evaluated for signs of umbilical cord infection (pus, redness, swelling). a nested case control approach was used to estimate the odds of mortality between infants with and without umbilical cord infection as defined by various levels of severity. for each death in the parent trial, controls were selected, matched on sex, treatment group, and number of cord assessments. the main outcome measures were all cause and sepsis specific mortality. results among 23,246 assessed infants, there were deaths. odds of all cause mortality were 46% (898%) higher among infants with redness extending onto the abdominal skin. a nonsignificant increased odds of mortality [odds ratio (or): 2.31; 95% confidence interval (ci): 0.668.10] was observed among infants with severe redness and pus. infections occurring after the third day of life were associated with subsequent risk of all cause (or: 3.11; 95% ci: 1.68 5.74) and sepsis specific (or: 4.63; 95% ci: 2.159.96) mortality. conclusions this study provides evidence that common local signs of cord infection are associated with increased risk of mortality. where exposure of the umbilical cord to potentially invasive pathogens is high, interventions to increase hygienic care of the cord should be promoted and including hand washing, avoiding harmful topical applications, and topical cord antisepsis.",0.5092592592592593,0.12383900928792568,0.25574931211312285

"Since its first success more than a decade ago, GWAS has become a popular and powerful approach to study human complex diseases. As of January 15, 2016, more than 15,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from over 2,000 publications had been documented in the GWAS Catalog . Despite its great success, GWAS has several notable limitations.The intergenic region upstream of HHIP on chromosome 4 has been repeatedly identified in multiple lung function GWAS (; ; ) and several COPD studies . Moreover, the signal pattern at this locus is highly consistent across different studies. A signal plateau that spans approximately 300Kb (145.25  145.55Mb; hg19) could be observed in all these studies.In this paper, we have applied various methods to integrate COPD GWAS summary statistics with genomic functional annotations, and illustrated how these integrative approaches could benefit complex disease research.

"Age related hearing loss, also known as presbycusis, is the most common form of hearing impairment in humans and is characterized by decreased hearing sensitivity, decreased ability to understand speech in a noisy environment, slowed central processing of acoustic stimuli, and impaired ability to detect the location of a sound. It is typically described as a downward sloping high frequency loss, meaning that hearing is better in the low and middle frequencies than in the high frequencies . Presbycusis is the third most prevalent chronic condition in older Americans, ranging from 25 to 40% in individuals  65 years of age (; ; ; U.S. Department of Commerce, 1997).A standardized questionnaire that included relevant questions about potential covariates was administered by interview.

"Vesicle fusion is followed by vesicle endocytosis, which forms new vesicles. Recycling of newly formed vesicles is crucial in maintaining synaptic transmission.

Wistar rats were decapitated. Parasagittal slices of 200 m thick were cut from the auditory brainstem with a vibratome.The present work revealed that activation of rapid endocytosis was not accompanied by faster RRP replenishment, and that block of both slow and rapid endocytosis did not affect the rate of the RRP replenishment. These results provided the first set of experimental evidence suggesting that both rapid and slow endocytosis did not recycle vesicles within the RRP, but within a large recycling pool more than 3 times the RRP size.

Some individuals are relieved that their symptoms are not indicative of a medical or cardiac diagnosis. Yet, a significant number of these patients continue to experience chest pain, worry about their cardiac function, and experience disability similar to patients with coronary artery disease despite their apparently favorable prognosis .The Albany Panic and Phobia Questionnaire revised (APPQ) is a 24 item questionnaire measuring situational, interoceptive, and social fear . This scale is a modification of the original scale . Patients rate how much fear they would expect to experience in certain activities and situations in the next week on a 0 (no fear) to 8 (extreme fear) Likert scale.Theories have posited a central role for body vigilance (i.e., conscious attention directed at internal physical sensations) in the development and persistence of NCCP (; ; ). In this study, we examined body vigilance by the rate and pattern of conscious monitoring and evaluation of internal sensations in patients with NCCP. We hypothesized that patients would be more vigilant to cardiac congruent sensations (e.g., heart palpitations, chest discomfort) than other bodily sensations that were cardiac incongruent (e.g., stomach upset, nausea, faintness, dizziness, numbness).",PMC2862826.json,"we investigated body vigilance, cardiac anxiety, and the mediating role of interoceptive fear on pain in patients with non cardiac chest pain (nccp; a syndrome of chest pain in the absence of identifiable organic etiology). patients were more attentive to cardiac congruent sensations than cardiac incongruent sensations (e.g., gastrointestinal, cognitive dyscontrol; p's < .001). patients with a dsm iv axis i anxiety or mood disorder were more body vigilant compared to patients who did not have a disorder (p's < .05). patients with anxiety disorders were particularly vigilant to and fearful of cardiac sensations relative to patients without anxiety disorders. latent variable path models examined the extent that interoceptive fear mediated the association between body vigilance and cardiac anxiety on chest pain. within each model, diagnostic status, body vigilance, and cardiac anxiety were exogenous and predicted interoceptive fear that in turn predicted pain. separate models examined body vigilance and cardiac anxiety, and both models fit the data well. findings showed partial mediation for the body vigilance factor, and full mediation for the cardiac anxiety factor. interoceptive fear played a mediating role in both models. the syndrome of nccp may persist partly due to conscious hypervigilance to and fear of cardiac congruent body sensations, particularly among anxious patients.",0.4,0.0821917808219178,0.22130419469571005
"Results from the Womens Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS) [; ; ; ] has caused many postmenopausal women to question whether to start or to continue hormone therapy (HT) to decrease the risk of developing dementia and has caused many others to question the role of estrogen in protecting cognitive function from age related decline in general.

In conjunction with the positive results of estrogen obtained in randomized clinical trials in younger women , multiple factors have led to the development of the critical period hypothesis in which it is theorized that estrogen exerts protective effects on cognition only when it is initiated closely in time to menopause, before neural systems become increasingly challenged by age related changes and/or neurons become less sensitive or responsive to HT .Neuroprotective effects of Estrogen Therapy for Cognitive and Neurobiological Profiles of Monkey Models of Menopause 19475542 Estrogen modulates many different aspects of DA function, including release, turnover, uptake, and receptors in OVX rodents [e.g., ; ; ; ; ].

"One of the salient features of biomineralization is that soluble proteins act in concert with an insoluble macromolecular scaffold to guide mineral formation. In some cases, such as tooth enamel, the scaffold is sacrificial, while in others, including bone and dentin, it becomes an intricate part of the resulting composite and contributes to tissue function. One of the major challenges to successful repair of mineralized tissues is that an intimate spatial and temporal relationship between mineral, scaffold and soluble matrix is critical to achieving the biomineral matrix ultrastructure necessary for that function, but that relationship is poorly understood and difficult to recreate.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of 70 nm ultra thin sections prepared from 2 specimens per group were carried out to determine ultra structures of remineralized lesion specimens and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) was used to identify the nature and crystallinity of the mineral formed by remineralization treatments. Sections from either artificial lesion or remineralization groups were embedded in Ultra Bed resin (Ultra Bed Kit: a modification of Spurrs resin. Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) after gradient dehydration in ethyl alcohol and then propylene oxide. Selected regions were trimmed, and ultrathin sections (70 nm) were cut in occlusal and sagittal planes with a diamond knife on an ultramicrotome (Reichert Jung Ultracut E, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany).To screen these candidate peptoids and assess their effectiveness in modulating calcium phosphate nucleation and growth in solution, we performed turbidity measurements commonly used in life science for drug compound solubility, bacterial or fungal growth studies, protein aggregation, antibody antigen interaction, and polymerization monitoring. Turbidity test provides a high throughput, miniaturized, and parallel method to detect mineral formation, because two replicates of 12 peptoids at four different concentrations were assessed at once in a 96 well plate. By measuring the time required for mineralization to occur  i.e., the incubation time  as compared to control runs containing no polymer, the ability of peptoids to inhibit or promote nucleation was determined ( and ) .",PMC5821432.json,"in calcified tissues such as bones and teeth, mineralization is regulated by an extracellular matrix, which includes non collagenous proteins (ncp). this natural process has been adapted or mimicked to restore tissues following physical damage or demineralization by using polyanionic acids in place of ncps, but the remineralized tissues fail to fully recover their mechanical properties. here we show that pre treatment with certain amphiphilic peptoids, a class of peptide like polymers consisting of n substituted glycines that have defined monomer sequences, enhances ordering and mineralization of collagen and induces functional remineralization of dentin lesions in vitro. in the vicinity of dentin tubules, the newly formed apatite nano crystals are co aligned with the c axis parallel to the tubular periphery and recovery of tissue ultrastructure is accompanied by development of high mechanical strength. the observed effects are highly sequence dependent with alternating polar and non polar groups leading to positive outcomes while diblock sequences have no effect. the observations suggest aromatic groups interact with the collagen while the hydrophilic side chains bind the mineralizing constituents and highlight the potential of synthetic sequence defined biomimetic polymers to serve as ncp mimics in tissue remineralization.",0.3256704980842912,0.011538461538461539,0.18381708574736005
"Triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) catalyzes the stereospecific, reversible 1,2 hydrogen shift at dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) to give (R) glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate (GAP) by a single base (carboxylate side chain of Glu 165) proton transfer mechanism through an enzyme bound cis enediolate intermediate ,, which is stabilized by a hydrogen bond between the enediolate oxyanion and the neutral imidazole side chain of His 95. Although the chemical mechanism for catalysis of deprotonation of  carbonyl carbon by TIM is similar to that observed for catalysis of this reaction by small Brnsted bases in solution,, the basicity of the Glu 165 carboxylate side chain may be greatly enhanced by the protein catalyst. The second order rate constant kcat/Km = 2.4  108 M1 s1 for TIM catalyzed isomerization of the free carbonyl form of GAP is 4  1010 fold larger than kB = 6.5  103 M1 s1 for deprotonation of GAP by the small tertiary amine quinuclidinone.The third order rate constant (kcat/Km)am/Kd for activation of the K12G mutant TIM catalyzed isomerization of GAP increases from 150 to 800 to 4100 M2 s1 when an H at NH4+ is replaced by first a methyl group to give CH3NH3+ and then by an ethyl group to give CH3CH2NH3+ . This is consistent with stabilization of the transition state by hydrophobic interactions between the enzyme and the side chain R of the ammonium cation activator RNH3+, resulting in an increase in the affinity of the cation for K12G mutant TIM (decrease in Kd and Kd, ). Lengthening of the side chain at RNH3+ to 3 and then to 4 carbons results in first a decrease in (kcat/Km)am/Kd to 2100 M2 s1 and then an increase to 9100 M2 s1 .These changes reflect subtle effects of the chain length of RNH3+ on the stability of the protein  RNH3+ complex.The slow nonenzymatic amine catalyzed isomerization of GAP to form DHAP was observed in earlier studies using tertiary amines at pH 8.1  9.0. However, in the present work, there was no change in the initial velocity for conversion of GAP to DHAP in the absence of K12G TIM (vo, see Experimental Section) as the concentrations of ammonium cations were increased from zero to 0.10 M at pH 7.5, 25 C and I = 0.10 (NaCl).

"Asthma and obesity have simultaneously become leading public health problems over the past several decades, resulting in consideration of underlying factors linking these health priorities. While debate exists, excess body weight appears associated with the development of asthma across the lifespan and particularly among women.

The average age difference between matched pairs was 2.2 months (SD = 10.6 months). Every attempt was made to have matched pairs complete the study within a 2 week window of one another to minimize potential effects of weather differences on activity level.Maximizing physical activity and minimizing sedentary behaviors are priorities for all children and adolescents, but are especially important for youth with asthma due to the increased risk of comorbid asthma and obesity.

"Antibodies to GM1 ganglioside were first identified in multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) sera by Pestronk and colleagues almost 25 years ago. Since then, extensive studies have examined the sensitivity and specificity of anti GM1 IgM antibody detection in MMN, related disorders and control populations(;;;;), using a range of assay methodologies(;;;;;;;;). Although no uniform consensus on methodology has been achieved, in part due to differences in defining patient populations and assay reproducibility, it is widely accepted that IgM antibodies to GM1 do occur in a significantly higher proportion of MMN cases compared with control groups.The ELISA method from the Glasgow Diagnostic Neuroimmunology Laboratory was used . Briefly, polystyrene plates (Immulon 2HB) were coated with ganglioside (GM1, GM2, GD1a, GD1b, GT1b, GQ1b, GA1, sulphatide and globoside at 200ng per well) in methanol to evaporation, then blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 1 h at 4C.

"The challenge we face in the post genome era is the daunting task of integrating many layers of information (genomic modification, control of transcript and protein levels, post transcriptional modification, metabolite and ion levels) and understanding how the regulations of these layers ensure the function of the system as a whole. Without a doubt, intricate intra and intercellular communication is required for the proper function of the higher order units such as tissues and organs. For example, the behavior of a neuronal cell is controlled by the fine balance between excitatory and inhibitory inputs dictated by the network within which the cell is placed and cannot be reproduced in an isolated cell.One of the most exciting outcomes of genetically encoded sensors is the possibility to examine correlations between signaling molecules. For example, the signaling pathways of Ca2+ and cAMP are interconnected; the enzymes that catalyze the synthesis and degradation of cAMP can be regulated by Ca2+ and conversely, cAMP can modulate Ca2+ influx through the plasma membrane by modulating the activities of Ca2+ channel proteins . The availability of genetically encoded cAMP sensors that can be spectrally separated from calcium dye enabled simultaneous measurement of two molecules in a single cell.Genetically encoded biosensors became indispensable tools to analyze information encoded in the transients of signaling molecules.

Quinone oxidation/reduction reactions occur in proteins such as the NADH:quinone reductase (Complex I), the cytochrome bc1 oxidoreductase (Complex II) and succinatequinone reductase (Complex III) in mitochondria and oxygenic bacteria .Modification of quinone electrochemistry by the proteins in the biological electron transfer chains: examples from photosynthetic reaction centers 18979192 The third contribution of the protein to the reaction comes from changes in electronic polarization, atomic position and nearby residue protonation in response to the changes in charge distribution caused by the redox reaction. In standard Continuum Electrostatics simulation methods the atomic positions are kept fixed. The energy of electronic polarization and atomic reorganization are accounted for by the assigned protein dielectric constant.The photosynthetic reaction centers are a well studied system where we have remarkable knowledge of the protein structures, reaction pathways, and cofactor electrochemistry and binding constants. This information makes it possible to understand how quinone properties are altered when bound to specific binding sites in the transmembrane electron transfer proteins. A continuum electrostatics analysis shows how the protein can stabilize an anionic semiquinone (QB) while destabilizing the dianion (QB=).",PMC2746407.json,"quinones such as ubiquinone are the lipid soluble electron and proton carriers in the membranes of mitochondria, chloroplasts and oxygenic bacteria. quinones undergo controlled redox reactions bound to specific sites in integral membrane proteins such as the cytochrome bc1 oxidoreductase. the quinone reactions in bacterial photosynthesis are amongst the best characterized, presenting a model to understand how proteins modulate cofactor chemistry. the free energy of ubiquinone redox reactions in aqueous solution and in the qa and qb sites of the bacterial photosynthetic reaction centers (rcs) are compared. in the primary qa site ubiquinone is reduced only to the anionic semiquinone (q) while in the secondary qb site the product is the doubly reduced, doubly protonated quinol (qh2). the ways in which the protein modifies the relative energy of each reduced and protonated intermediate are described. for example, the protein stabilizes q while destabilizing q= relative to aqueous solution through electrostatic interactions. in addition, kinetic and thermodynamic mechanisms for stabilizing the intermediate semiquinones are compared. evidence for the protein sequestering anionic compounds by slowing both on and off rates as well as by binding the anion more tightly is reviewed.",0.5314009661835749,0.17475728155339804,0.32147687839305195

"Tumor necrosis factoralpha [TNF] is an early proinflammatory cytokine.

However, these present experiments revealed that one must be careful in the interpretation of cFOS activation data and not presume that all that is activated is neuronal.

"Suicide is a leading cause of death in the United States and worldwide . Mortality data indicate that one person dies by suicide somewhere around the world every 40 seconds . The high rate of suicide results in part from the fact that assessment primarily depends on peoples explicit self report, which is unreliable because people often are motivated to deny their suicidal thoughts .Attentional Bias toward Suicide Related Stimuli Predicts Suicidal Behavior Our first hypothesis was that patients with a history of suicide attempt would show an attentional bias toward suicide related stimuli but not toward negatively valenced stimuli relative to psychiatrically distressed control participants. Consistent with this prediction, independent sample t tests revealed that interference for suicide related words was significantly greater among suicide attempters than non attempters, t(122)=2.37, p=.02, d=0.43, but no group differences in interference for negatively valenced words, t(122)=0.57, p=.57, d=0.10 (see ).

"Among a dozen or so genes affecting the natural history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV infection), HLA class I shows the strongest association with progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) [ ]. In response to HIV infection, HLA class I molecules play important roles in both T cell mediated adaptive immunity and natural killer (NK) cell mediated innate immunity. Individual HLA class I may influence AIDS pathogenesis by binding and presenting immuno dominant HIV epitopes to T cells and/or interacting with killer immunoglobulin like receptors (KIR) to regulate NK cell activity[, ].The subjects for the analysis of HIV transmission were participants in the Multicenter Hemophilia Cohort Study (MHCS), a prospective study of patients with hemophilia and their female partners enrolled at hemophilia treatment sites in the United States and Europe . Between 1986 and 1998, MHCS investigators enrolled women who had had vaginal intercourse with an MHCS participant into a study of heterosexual HIV 1 transmission. At enrollment, the female partner completed a standardized self administered questionnaire that included questions about HIV 1 exposure and sexual practices.Diversity in the MHC has been identified as the most significant AIDS regulating genetic factor .

"Becoming aware that one is dreaming while dreaming, what is today referred to as lucid dreaming, has been known about since antiquity. In Western literature, it may have first been mentioned by Aristotle in the fourth century BCE in the treatise On dreams of his Parva Naturali, in which he states: often when one is asleep, there is something in consciousness which declares that what then presents itself is but a dream (, p. 624). Likewise, in Eastern cultures, particularly of the south Asian subcontinent, reports of individuals engaging in practices to cultivate awareness of dream and sleep states date back millennia (; ; ).10.1016/j.neubiorev.2019.03.008 The activated EEG of REM sleep was originally thought to be exclusively associated with dreaming , while the low frequency activity of non REM (NREM) sleep was thought to be associated with the absence of dreaming. Subsequent research has shown, however, that participants report dreams or related forms of sleep mentation in up to 70% of awakenings from NREM sleep (; ; ). NREM dreams tend to be less emotional and visually vivid, as well as more thought like .Despite having been physiologically validated for approximately four decades, the neurobiology of lucid dreaming is still incompletely characterized.

"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies often require the use of multiple subjects, in which fMRI data from a group of participants are processed together to yield a population activation result . This is particularly the case for neurological and psychiatric studies that aim for better understanding of disease mechanism. A major challenge in finding differences in fMRI signals between patients and controls is that the disease effect is often buried inside the large noise attributed to inter subject variations.Improving fMRI sensitivity by normalization of basal physiologic state 19585589 All MR imaging experiments were conducted on a 3 Tesla MR system (Philips Medical System, Best, The Netherlands). A total of twenty healthy subjects (29.36.6 years old, 11 men and 9 women) were scanned for this study. Each subject gave an informed written consent before participating in the study.Basal venous oxygenation can be used to normalize fMRI signals across subjects. The utility of this method was demonstrated in a model situation in which two visual stimuli with different flashing frequencies were used to stimulate two subject groups, respectively, thereby simulating the situation of control and patient groups. It was found that the normalization process can substantially reduce p values of statistical tests and can allow the detection of more significant voxels.",PMC2797559.json,"the power of fmri in assessing neural activities is hampered by inter subject variations in basal physiologic parameters, which may not be related to neural activation but has a modulatory effect on fmri signals. therefore, normalization of fmri signals with these parameters is useful in reducing variations and improving sensitivity of this important technique. recently, we have shown that basal venous oxygenation is a significant modulator of fmri signals and individuals with higher venous oxygenation tend to have lower fmri signals. in this study, we aim to test the utility of venous oxygenation normalization in distinguishing subject groups. a model condition was used in which two visual stimuli with different flashing frequencies were used to stimulate two subject groups, respectively, thereby simulating the situation of control and patient groups. it was found that visual evoked bold signal is significantly correlated with baseline venous t2 (p=0.0003) and inclusion of physiologic modulator in the regression analysis can substantially reduce p values of group level statistical tests. when applied to voxel wise analysis, the normalization process can allow the detection of more significant voxels. the utility of other basal parameters, including blood pressure, heart rate, arterial oxygenation and end tidal co2, in bold normalization was also assessed and it was found that the improvement was less significant. time to peak of the bold responses was also studied and it was found that subjects with higher basal venous oxygenation tend to have slower bold responses.",0.5175438596491228,0.2643171806167401,0.40481870820059096
"Telomeres are the end points of chromosomal DNA. They consist of highly conserved repeated short sequences, and cap the terminal ends of human DNA. Characterizing the dynamics of telomeres has been an important goal in cell biology; telomeres are believed to be important for maintaining chromosome stability .The method for measuring the telomere length using a flow cytometer has been extensively described in details in the following reports by , and and  . DNA melting, FITC PNA oligonucleotide probe binding and DNA annealing are all highly time and temperature dependent. Careful bench technique, adherence to the incubation times and precise sample temperature control are all critical in obtaining reproducible results.The results above show that FISH flow analysis of telomere length can be done in combination with prior fluorescent immunophenotyping by using quantum dots as the fluorescent probes. Almost all traditional fluorescent probes, both low molecular weight and phycobiliproteins, are either lost or damaged following high heat treatment. The inorganic structure of quantum dots presumably makes them resistant to the harsh heating conditions required for PNA probe hybridization.",PMC2752384.json,"telomere length analysis has been greatly simplified by the quantitative flow cytometry technique flow fish. in this method, a fluorescein labeled synthetic oligonucleotide complementary to the telomere terminal repeat sequence is hybridized to the telomere sequence and the resulting fluorescence measured by flow cytometry. this technique has supplanted the traditional laborious southern blot telomere length measurement techniques in many laboratories, and allows single cell analysis of telomere length in high throughput sample formats. nevertheless, the harsh conditions required for telomere probe annealing (82c) has made it difficult to successfully combine this technique with simultaneous immunolabeling. most traditional organic fluorescent probes (i.e. fluorescein, phycoerythrin, etc.) have limited thermal stability and do not survive the high temperature annealing process, despite efforts to covalently crosslink the antigen antibody fluorophore complex. this loss of probe fluorescence has made it difficult to measure flow fish in complex lymphocyte populations, and has generally forced investigators to use fluorescent activated cell sorting to pre separate their populations, a laborious technique that requires prohibitively large numbers of cells. in this study, we have substituted quantum dots (nanoparticles) for traditional fluorophores in fish flow. quantum dots were demonstrated to possess much greater thermal stability than traditional low molecular weight and phycobiliprotein fluorophores. quantum dot antibody conjugates directed against monocyte and t cell antigens were found to retain most of their fluorescence following the high temperature annealing step, allowing simultaneous fluorescent immunophenotyping and telomere length measurement. since quantum dots have very narrow emission bandwidths, we were able to analyze multiple quantum dot antibody conjugates (qdot 605, and 705) simultaneously with fish flow measurement to assess the age associated decline in telomere length in both human monocytes and t cell subsets. with quantum dot immunolabeling, the mean decrease rate in telomere length for cd4+ cells was calculated at 41.8bp/year, very close to previously reported values using traditional flow fish and southern blotting. this modification to the traditional flow fish technique should therefore allow simultaneous fluorescent immunophenotyping and telomere length measurement, permitting complex cell subset specific analysis in small numbers of cells without the requirement for prior cell sorting.",0.38022813688212925,0.08396946564885496,0.2141658521929785
"Glycosylation, one of the most important co and post translational modifications of proteins, plays a significant role in numerous biological processes including protein folding and stability, cellular adhesion, signaling and disease.

Similar to the chicken or the egg debate, this study sought to clarify whether mentally ill inmates are psychiatric patients that end up in the criminal justice system, or whether they are criminals that happen to be mentally ill. Consistent with and hypotheses, the results of this study indicated that mentally ill inmates presented with severe mental illness and psychiatric symptomatology comparable to that of non inmate psychiatric populations as well as criminal thinking comparable to non mentally ill inmates (with the exception that contrary to results of , female offenders in this study did not produce higher scores on scales of criminal thinking when compared to their male counterparts).",PMC2987583.json,"to examine the prevalence of criminal thinking in mentally disordered offenders, incarcerated male (n = 265) and female (n = 149) offenders completed measures of psychiatric functioning and criminal thinking. results indicated 92% of the participants were diagnosed with a serious mental illness, and mentally disordered offenders produced criminal thinking scores on the psychological inventory of criminal thinking styles (picts) and criminal sentiments scale modified (css m) similar to that of non mentally ill offenders. collectively, results indicated the clinical presentation of mentally disordered offenders is similar to that of psychiatric patients and criminals. implications are discussed with specific focus on the need for mental health professionals to treat co occurring issues of mental illness and criminality in correctional mental health treatment programs.",0.3738317757009346,0.14553990610328638,0.24013723148549349

"Complex diseases or phenotypes like longevity may have multiple genetic and environmental causes. The complexity arises from the fact that many genetic and environmental factors may interact with each other such that the expression of the phenotype may not be accurately predictable based on knowledge of the individual effects for each of the component factors considered alone. Genetic interactions or epistasis could hold the key to understanding of complex conditions such as Alzheimers disease and diabetes .In a traditional case control study, a permutation test can be performed by shuffling the phenotype, i.e. randomly assign phenotype labels to the samples. The procedure produces a null distribution of the test statistic which can be used for obtaining an empirical significance level for the statistic of the original data . In the case only design, phenotype based permutation is inapplicable because all samples are of the same phenotype, i.e. cases.We have introduced a novel resampling based approach to enable case only analysis of gene gene interactions using multiple SNPs data.

The main finding is that rh10 was superior to the other serotypes in transduction of tissues, level of expression, and maintenance of expression and copy number in both mitotically active and postmitotic tissues in neonates with vector administration shortly after birth. In addition, these studies demonstrate that",PMC2948027.json,"background neonatal gene therapy is a promising strategy for treating diseases diagnosed before or shortly after birth. early and long term expression of therapeutic proteins may limit the consequences of genetic mutations and result in a potential cure. adeno associated viral vectors have shown promise in many areas of adult gene therapy but their properties have not been systematically investigated in the neonate. methods in these studies using a constitutive promoter expressing luciferase, animals were administered one of ten serotypes of aav on the second day of life. examination of expression, organ growth and vector distribution, maintenance of expression and copy number were examined. results all serotypes demonstrated expression and, in general, transduction of all organs within days, albeit with different biodistribution patterns and expression levels. highest expression was detected with aavrh10 while lowest was with aav4. expression and genomes declined with growth over the first weeks of life; thereafter, to day 100, expression and genomes remained relatively stable. with the highest expressing vectors, whole animal expression at days declined to ~10% of that detected on the fifth day. aavrh10 maintained the highest expression level and copy number throughout these studies. conclusion the impact of tissue and organ growth on the stability of aav expression will be important if neonatal gene transfer is to be considered as a modality for human gene therapy. while all vectors did demonstrate expression, rh10 holds the greater promise of the vectors tested to maintain copy number in both mitotic and post mitotic tissues.",0.5398773006134969,0.2053388090349076,0.35266270217072027
"Finger joints are often the first joints affected in rheumatoid (RA) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) , and they are also commonly involved in osteoarthritis (OA) . In RA and PsA, the early months of joint inflammation are critical because during this period irreversible damage can occur (, ).

"The ends of eukaryotic chromosomes are capped by a particular chromatin structure which constitutes the telomere. Telomeres are composed by specific tandemly repeated G rich DNA sequences organized with arrays of protein complexes and a long non coding RNA (TERRA: Telomere Repeat Containing RNA), constituting a tightly packed higher order structure. This special organization is essential for the maintenance of the integrity of the genome, protecting the chromosomes from terminal degradation and end to end fusion,.Biospecimens from a small subsample of OAI participants at baseline had been analyzed for PBL telomere length as a component of a research program evaluating the influence of mtDNA haplogroups on telomere length in the OAI as a comparison group to a white Caucasian Spanish cohort,. Because of population genetic considerations this OAI sample was confined to Caucasian participants and was sampled across the progression (n=129), incidence (n=87) and non exposed control subcohorts (n=96) . Mean telomere length of PBLs from the DNA samples was determined using a validated quantitative PCR based assay.To study the association between radiographic hand OA and telomere length we conducted a cross sectional and longitudinal analysis of data from a subset of participants in the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) who had measurement of PBL telomere length from biospecimens obtained at baseline .

"A fundamental hypothesis in cognitive psychology is that the working memory system is capacity limited in terms of the number of chunks that can be stored or maintained at once . Prior research has demonstrated that both the number and size of chunks that are concurrently stored in working memory can be estimated from task performance (e.g., ). It is possible to ask, then, whether the number and/or size of chunks changes with age in adulthood.Several findings provide insight into which types of language stimuli young and older adults will be more likely to recall, as well as where aging deficits might be found using the measures described above. It was expected that sentences that were more meaningful in terms of their coherence would be better recalled than those sentences that had little or no coherence. We found that participants were indeed more likely to recall words from these meaningfully constructed sentences than pseudo sentences that were haphazard in their structure.All participant responses were verbally transcribed by the experimenter. Three different measures were used to examine age differences in recall of the different trial conditions: total words recalled, clause access, and clause completion. Total words recalled simply involved the number of words correctly recalled from each condition.",PMC2610466.json,"previous studies show that older adults have poorer immediate recall for language but the reason is unknown. older adults may recall fewer chunks from working memory, or may have difficulty binding words together to form multi unit chunks. we examined these two hypotheses by presenting types of spoken sentences for immediate free recall, differing in the number and length of chunks per trial: short, simple sentences; such sentences; compound sentences, each incorporating two meaningful, short sentences; and random word lists, each under a sentence like intonation. older adults recalled words from (accessed) fewer clauses than young adults, but there was no aging deficit in the degree of completion of clauses that were accessed. an age related decline in working memory capacity measured in chunks appears to account for deficits in memory for spoken language.",0.40816326530612246,0.07624633431085044,0.20831327247026987
"The worm like micelle is a classic one dimensional self assembly, but compared to vesicles or spherical micelles that can also assemble from amphiphiles, worm like micelles are less stable to perturbations. While assembly of amphiphiles in water invariably minimizes solvent phobic contacts in the core of the micelle and maximizes solvent philic contacts within the corona, the vesicle/worm/sphere morphologies are typically understood at a first level in terms of a packing parameter p = v/alc that is determined by molecular volume v of the packed hydrophobic segment, contour length lc of the hydrophobic segment (lc  d/2), and interfacial area a of the hydrophilic segment. The range of p allowable for a given morphology is then calculated from core volume and interfacial area [eg. sphere: p=(6d3)(d2lc)1=013], and the cylinder shaped worm like micelle proves by such determinations to have a 23 fold narrower range of p(=1312) compared to either spherical micelles or vesicle bilayers (p=121).Curvature driven molecular demixing in the budding and breakup of mixed component Worm like Micelles 20668645 1IsraelachviliJNIntermolecular and Surface Forces1992Academic Press2BagshawSAProuzetEPinnavaiaTJScience199526912421244177321093TaylorKCNasr El DinHAJournal of Petroleum Science and Engineering1998192652804JainSBatesFSScience2003300460464127028695KaraborniSEsselinkEHilbersPAJSmitBKarthauserJvan OsNMZanaRScience1994266254256177714456WangXSGuerinGWangHWangYMannersIWinnikMAScience2007317644647176736567CuiHGChenZYZhongSWooleyKLPochanDJScience20078GengYDischerDEPolymer200647251925259NapoliAValentiniMTirelliNMullerMHubbellJAJ.

"Aggressive periodontitis (AP) is a rapidly progressing periodontal disease with a tendency toward familial aggregation, occurring in either localized or generalized forms. Aside from periodontal manifestations, a frequent finding in patients with AP is abnormal polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) chemotactic function.

"In the last decade, wireless, passive sensors based on the magnetically soft, magnetoelastic materials have gained popularity for remote measurement of physical and biological/chemical parameters [ ]. These sensors, known as the magnetoelastic sensors, are simple in design, in most cases nothing more than just a rectangular strip of magnetoelastic ferromagnetic alloy. Under an AC magnetic field excitation, these sensors physically vibrate due to their magnetic soft and magnetoelastic properties, which efficiently convert magnetic field energy to mechanical vibration and vice versa.Using , the changes in the maximum 2nd order harmonic fields of the sensor were calculated as a function of stress. The anisotropy field at zero stress, Hk0, was set as 150 A/m , and the saturation magnetostriction and induction were 12 ppm and 0.88 Tesla, respectively . shows the amplitude of the 2nd order harmonic spectrum, plotted against the ratio of the DC biasing field to the AC excitation field, at varying stresses.The fabrication and application of a wireless, passive sensor for monitoring pressure in flowing fluid was demonstrated.

"Although cigarette smoking is the single largest preventable cause of death, approximately one fifth of Americans continue to smoke . About 80% of all primary lung cancers are attributable to smoking .

"Developmental researchers have long been interested in understanding how various caregiving experiences, both within and outside of children's homes, impact child development and well being. An important extension of this line of inquiry focuses on changes in caregiving contexts due to child maltreatment and the subsequent out of home placement of children by Child Protective Services (CPS). Knowing whether out of home placement by CPS mitigates or heightens developmental risk for maltreated children is crucial for assessing the efficacy of child welfare policies and interventions, as well as for understanding the relative risks and benefits of major discontinuities in children's care.This study used data from the National Survey on Child and Adolescent Well Being, which was developed under contract with the Administration on Children, Youth, and Families, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (ACYF/DHHS). The data were provided by the National Data Archive on Child Abuse and Neglect.

That placement does not appear to help or harm children in the domains of cognitive functioning or behavior problems may reflect the continued influence of other ongoing risks or of early maltreatment experiences and other ecological adversities on child well being.

Compared to traditional X rays, microwave energy is advantageous in several important respects, for example, it does not involve ionization, its associated imaging hardware is relatively low in cost and its absorption and scattering is altered by physiological processes of interest in tissue.Viable Three Dimensional Medical Microwave Tomography: Theory and Numerical Experiments 20352084 Using the previous reconstructions as a benchmark, we tested five dual mesh methods, i.e. the scalar 2D method , FDTD 2D method , semi 3D method , scalar 3D and vector 3D methods, and summarized the problem size and computational times in . All computations were performed on an Alpha ES40 workstation with 4 600 MHz CPUs. From the table, we observe predictable trends when the problem size increases and when the reconstruction transitions from 2D to 3D.We have developed two 3D image reconstruction approaches including a 3D scalar field/3D reconstruction technique based on the FE method and a 3D vector field/3D reconstruction algorithm based on the FDTD method. The adjoint scheme devised in was extended to a nodal based approximation which significantly simplified the Jacobian matrix calculation and also led to an associated reduction in computation time. Additional enhancements in the 3D FDTD algorithm with respect to the image reconstruction problem were investigated including the use of initial field estimates and the ADI FDTD method.",PMC2844097.json,"three dimensional microwave tomography represents a potentially very important advance over 2d techniques because it eliminates associated approximations which may lead to more accurate images. however, with the significant increase in problem size, computational efficiency is critical to making 3d microwave imaging viable in practice. in this paper, we present two 3d image reconstruction methods utilizing 3d scalar and vector field modeling strategies, respectively. finite element (fe) and finite difference time domain (fdtd) algorithms are used to model the electromagnetic field interactions in human tissue in 3d. image reconstruction techniques previously developed for the 2d problem, such as the dual mesh scheme, iterative block solver, and adjoint jacobian method are extended directly to 3d reconstructions. speed improvements achieved by setting an initial field distribution and utilizing an alternating direction implicit (adi) fdtd are explored for 3d vector field modeling. the proposed algorithms are tested with simulated data and correctly recovered the position, size and electrical properties of the target. the adjoint formulation and the fdtd method utilizing initial field estimates are found to be significantly more effective in reducing the computation time. finally, these results also demonstrate that cross plane measurements are critical for reconstructing 3d profiles of the target.",0.5200000000000001,0.12946428571428573,0.2422188403082939

Among minors who used this option, 55% were 17 year olds, 34% were 16 year olds and the remainder were 15 or younger. The age distribution among those who obtained parental consent was substantially different42% were 17 years old, 30% were 16 and 28% were 15 or younger.If the change from a parental notification to a parental consent requirement is associated with a decline in abortions, then the abortion rate among minors will drop relative to that among older adolescents following implementation of a new law.

"Phoneme awareness assessment has become a critical part of early identification and diagnosis of reading disability.

Already in 1845, Griesinger postulated that senility can be attributed to arteriosclerosis but vascular dementia (VaD) was clearly delineated by Otto Binswanger and Alois Alzheimer who first recognized its specificity by separating it from neurosyphilis . Since then, arteriosclerotic lesions of cerebral blood vessels were considered a major cause of dementia even though the biological mechanisms surrounding this phenomenon remained poorly understood.The impact of vascular burden on late life depression 19744522  ) seminal work establishing a link between VaD and the volume of cerebral infarcts larger than 100 ml was rapidly contested by the results of that changed the focus from the volume of the lesions to their location and proposed the landmark notion of strategic macroinfarcts. More recently, the definition of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) pointed first to the possible role of small vessel disease in white and deep gray matter as a cause of cognitive decline. According to a recent multi centre study, the importance of small vessel disease as a cause of VaD has been underestimated. A recent epidemiological study revealed that among patients with VaD, 74% had small vessel disease and only 18% presented with large vessel disease while 8% had both .Structural and functional neuroimaging have certainly offered new perspectives in the domain of aging research, even though the initial expectations of a direct lesionsyndrome relationship are far from being fulfilled. Despite strong epidemiological evidence supporting a close relationship between vascular disease and mood dysregulation in old age (; ; ; ; ), neuroimaging studies focusing on acute ischemic events failed to identify an unequivocal structural background for late life depression. The concept of vascular depression was the first to suggest a shift of focus proposing that the chronic accumulation of small vascular and microvascular lesions is not a benign aging related phenomenon.",PMC2915936.json,"small vessel pathology and microvascular lesions are no longer considered as minor players in the fields of cognitive impairment and mood regulation. although frequently found in cognitively intact elders, both neuroimaging and neuropathological data revealed the negative impact on cognitive performances of their presence within neocortical association areas, thalamus and basal ganglia. unlike cognition, the relationship between these lesions and mood dysregulation is still a matter of intense debate. early studies focusing on the role of macroinfarct location in the occurrence of post stroke depression (psd) led to conflicting data. later on, the concept of vascular depression proposed a deleterious effect of subcortical lacunes and deep white matter demyelination on mood regulation in elders who experienced the first depressive episode. more recently, the chronic accumulation of lacunes in thalamus, basal ganglia and deep white matter has been considered as a strong correlate of psd. we provide here a critical overview of neuroimaging and neuropathological sets of evidence regarding the affective repercussions of vascular burden in the aging brain and discuss their conceptual and methodological limitations. based on these observations, we propose that the accumulation of small vascular and microvascular lesions constitutes a common neuropathological platform for both cognitive decline and depressive episodes in old age.",0.40301318267419967,0.14366729678638943,0.2538094831403755
"Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is a measurement of kidney filtration and excretion that can detect decreases in organ function far earlier than more widely used markers of renal function. Despite its superiority for detecting early renal dysfunction, measurement of GFR remains an underused tool in the diagnosis and management of kidney disease in veterinary medicine. Serum creatinine concentration has replaced GFR measurement in most clinical settings because of its ease and widespread availability; however, because serum creatinine likely does not increase above reference range until approximately 75% of nephrons are nonfunctional, and falsely increased creatinine concentrations may occur with some assays, the sensitivity and specificity of creatinine for diagnosis of kidney disease should be considered inferior to actual determination of GFR .An overview of glomerular filtration rate testing in dogs and cats 20541957 Creatinine is freely filtered by the glomerulus and is not protein bound. It is produced at a constant rate from breakdown of creatine phosphate in muscle tissues and is only minimally influenced by protein intake, metabolism or physical activity . Although creatinine is not reabsorbed by the renal tubules, it is secreted to a small degree in male dogs, which may lead to an overestimation of GFR .Although GFR measurement allows earlier detection of renal disease than other available assays, it is still a highly underutilized tool in dogs and cats.

"As a homodimeric glycoprotein of the transforming growth factor  (TGF ) superfamily, antimullerian hormone (AMH) is emerging as an important regulator of mammalian follicle development . Produced by granulosa cells of growing follicles after birth , AMH levels normally are low in primary follicles, increase to maximal levels in large preantral and small antral stages, and then decline during final follicular maturation, becoming restricted to cumulus cells surrounding the oocyte . Serum AMH concentrations correlate with the numbers of antral follicles before and with the ovarian response to gonadotropin therapy for IVF ET , and diminish after oophorectomy to those of ovary intact postmenopausal women .Institutional Review Board approval was obtained before initiation of the study and fully informed consent was obtained from 26 normoandrogenic ovulatory women undergoing gonadotropin therapy for IVF ET.

"Adolescence is a stage of development in which the incidence of mood related disorders emerges.

"Diffusion based magnetic resonance imaging techniques have shown promises in the study of white matter microstructure and anatomical connectivity of the brain. Image registration is a crucial step for accurate group analyses of diffusion imaging data and for building white matter and fiber tract atlases. With the assumption of a Gaussian distribution of the molecular diffusion, the second order diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides a relatively simple approach for quantifying diffusion anisotropy and for extracting local fiber directions.To study the effect of registrations with different SH orders, the diffusion images were reconstructed with L = 2, 4, 6, 8. The proposed method is general to any order of SHs. Since the second order tensor model can be represented using SHs with L = 2, registration based on tensor models and SHs with L = 2 contain the same amount of information.The registration performance improvement using SHs with higher orders compared to the second order can be explained in that the higher order coefficients provide more information in fiber crossing regions, and this additional information helps the registration to better align the ODF shapes and therefore better align the local structures to the corresponding ones in the reference. Complex structures such as crossing fibers occur not only in white matter, but also in gray matter. Therefore, compared to tensor based methods, registrations using higher order models have the potential to better align white and gray matter regions .",PMC3860760.json,"non rigid registration of diffusion mri is crucial for group analyses and building white matter and fiber tract atlases. most current diffusion mri registration techniques are limited to the alignment of diffusion tensor imaging (dti) data. we propose a novel diffeomorphic registration method for high angular resolution diffusion images by mapping their orientation distribution functions (odfs). odfs can be reconstructed using q ball imaging (qbi) techniques and represented by spherical harmonics (shs) to resolve intra voxel fiber crossings. the registration is based on optimizing a diffeomorphic demons cost function. unlike scalar images, deforming odf maps requires odf reorientation to maintain its consistency with the local fiber orientations. our method simultaneously reorients the odfs by computing a wigner rotation matrix at each voxel, and applies it to the sh coefficients during registration. rotation of the coefficients avoids the estimation of principal directions, which has no analytical solution and is time consuming. the proposed method was validated on both simulated and real data sets with various metrics, which include the distance between the estimated and simulated transformation fields, the standard deviation of the general fractional anisotropy and the directional consistency of the deformed and reference images. the registration performance using shs with different maximum orders were compared using these metrics. results show that the diffeomorphic registration improved the affine alignment, and registration using shs with higher order shs further improved the registration accuracy by reducing the shape difference and improving the directional consistency of the registered and reference odf maps.",0.4927536231884058,0.1663201663201663,0.3090064768781768
"Accuracy is an important goal of sensorimotor behavior. In the face of uncertain and changing environments, both external and internal, sensorimotor systems have to adapt and maintain accurate registration. For example, the saccadic system controls ballistic eye movements called saccades that foveate images of interest and remain accurate despite aging, injury or fatigue.Secondary adaptation of memory guided saccades During the memory guided saccade adaptation (MGSA) paradigm, we measured the gain of the primary saccades as well as the gain of the final secondary saccade with respect to the original target before feedback. shows the evolution of saccades during the task for a representative subject. During the preadapt block, the subject remembered the location of the briefly flashed target while maintaining fixation and then made a saccade to the remembered location at the end of the delay.In this study, we find evidence of two processes occurring in parallel to maintain saccade accuracy. One learning mechanism may involve precise calibration of a time constrained teaching signal with the saccadic motor command to drive adaptation, and when this process is hampered, a second learning mechanism acts to compensate for saccadic errors, suggesting that the sensorimotor system can utilize multiple learning mechanisms in real life to maintain optimal registration between vision and action .

"Hematopoietic Stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a therapeutic modality utilized to cure many malignant and nonmalignant hematological conditions. Approximately 4065% of all HSCT recipients develop some form of pulmonary complications, accounting for a considerable morbidity and mortality []. Of these, pleural effusion is a frequently encountered complication representing both diagnostic and therapeutic challenge.Of seventy one patients with symptomatic pleural effusions, concurrent CT thorax was performed in 60 patients, and estimation of the size of pleural effusions was determined. The pleural effusions were large in 11 (15%), moderate in 30 (42%), and small in 19 (26%) patients. The vast majority of patients [i.e. 52 (73%)] had bilateral pleural effusions.In our retrospective study, the cumulative incidence of pleural effusion at one year was 9.9% (95% CI, 7.7  12.5%) which is lower than 16% reported by Noble et al. 27 years ago. The reason for lower incidence at 1 year could be explained by better patient selection with improved screening and transplant eligibility criteria, improved techniques of HLA matching and advances in supportive care including antibiotics and GVHD prophylaxis.

"Diffuse Optical Tomography (DOT) is the tomographic variant of Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS). These methods complement functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) of human brain activation by providing measures of changes in both oxygenated (HbO) and deoxygenated (HbR) hemoglobin with a superior temporal resolution (see ; ; ; for a review). NIRS requires only compact experimental systems, is less restrictive, and is relatively forgiving of body movement, and thus provides one with a wide variety of flexible measurement options of brain function in adults and infants (reviewed in ; ) .Anatomical Atlas Guided Diffuse Optical Tomography of Brain Activation 19643185 We used a Monte Carlo solution of the Radiative Transport Equation (RTE) to simulate photon migration in highly scattering tissues . Alternatively, it is possible to use faster but less accurate methods based on Diffusion Approximation (for example, less than 28.4% error in time domain partial path length prediction using Finite difference algorithm, as reported in ). Monte Carlo method models photon trajectories through heterogeneous tissues, reproducing the randomness of each scattering event in a stochastic fashion, and histograms the spatial distribution of the photon trajectories to estimate the Green's function of the photon fluence.In this paper we introduced an imaging protocol that uses Diffuse Optical Tomography (DOT) to reconstruct brain activation images without the need of the subject's anatomical MRI. The approach consists of using an atlas based anatomical model instead of the subject's anatomy and solving the photon migration forward model on the atlas model, while acquiring optical measurements from the subject, and then reconstructing the cortical activation in the registered atlas.

"The ability to identify natural sounds is a fundamental function of the central auditory system. In humans and macaque monkeys, the ability to discriminate speech and con specific vocalizations is an integral part of normal social interactions.

Over the past decade, a number of different brain areas have been implicated as key parts of the neural time keeping mechanism in the milliseconds to a few seconds time range: notably, the cerebellum , the right posterior parietal cortex (Bueti, Bahrami, & Walsh, 2008), the right prefrontal cortex , a right fronto parietal network , and fronto (SMA) striatal circuits (; ; ; ).14 right handed subjects (7 female/7 male); mean age: 25 (age range: 20 to 32) participated in a temporal reproduction task while undergoing fMRI.

Upon cleavage by thrombin, activated FVIII disassociates from VWF, binds to phospholipid, and facilitates blood clotting .To explore whether a preformed complex of VWF with FVIII provides more effective protection from inhibitors versus unbound VWF, a series of mixing order experiments were performed using plasmas from immunized VWFnullFVIIInull mice as the inhibitor source. rhVWF (at 1 U mL1) was either added to (1 U mL1) rhFVIII first followed by mixing with inhibitory plasma, allowing VWF and FVIII to pre associate into a non covalent complex before exposure to inhibitory antibodies, or VWF was mixed with inhibitory plasma first followed by addition of rhFVIII so VWF and antibodies encounter FVIII at the same time.

"Descriptions of pain quality, such as throbbing, aching, or sharp pain, provide invaluable clues to the underlying diagnosis. However, we know very little about the neurophysiological events underlying these clinically relevant pain qualities. Throbbing, pulsatile pain is one such quality that has long been presumed to arise in the periphery, as a sensory experience of arterial pulsations.EEG data were preprocessed as follows: (1) bandpass filtering with cutoffs set at 0.53 and 50Hz and downsampling to a frequency of 250Hz, (2) re referencing each channel against the average reference, (3) using independent component analysis (ICA EEGLAB 7.2 tutorial, sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab) to remove muscle artifacts, movement artifacts and excessive eye blinks.

"Ensemble averaged evoked potentials (EPs), recorded from the scalp following auditory stimulation, contain three main components: a positive (P50), negative (N100), and a positive (P200) component occurring at 50 100, 110 140, and 160 200 ms, respectively . The P50 is frequently used to assess sensory gating, i.e., the central nervous systems ability to modulate its response to the second of a pair of identical stimuli. Typically, sensory gating is expressed in terms of the S2/S1 ratio, which is computed as the ratio of the EP due to the second stimulus over the first stimulus response.Auditory Evoked Potential Variability in Healthy and Schizophrenia Subjects 20363180 The same analysis was repeated on the schizophrenia data, starting with classifying the S2 responses using the S1 clusters obtained from the schizophrenia participants. Two trials could not be assigned to any of P50 classes, four other trials to the N100 classes and another four trials to P200. It can be seen from that the distribution of the S2 responses over the eight EP categories is essentially the same as for S1, and no significant differences (U tests) were found for any of the eight response categories .The results obtained from the overall averages can be compared to previous studies and do confirm that schizophrenia patients have smaller S1 responses than normal controls. Since no inter population differences were found for S2, the patient population will show less gating than the normal control group, which also matches previous work.

"In a series of previous publications, we have developed an approach to improving density functional theory (DFT) methods based on empirical localized orbital corrections (DFT LOC). When used in conjunction with the B3LYP functional (B3LYP LOC, which will be the focus of the present publication), these corrections provide a remarkable improvement in atomization energies, ionization potentials and electron affinities, and heats of reaction for molecules composed of atoms in the first two rows of the periodic table as detailed in sections II.A, II.B, and II.D, respectively. Recently we have also demonstrated improvements for thermochemistry of small transition metal species as summarized in section II.C.Localized orbital corrections for the calculation of barrier heights in density functional theory In a subsequent publication, the B3LYP LOC methodology was extended from atomization energies to ionization potentials (IP) and electron affinities (EA). In this manner, B3LYP LOC can now be extended to ionic in addition to neutral molecules with 37 parameters developed specifically for charged species. (Be that as it may, only six of these parameters were employed here, as they cover the most common chemistries, such as those studied in this work.)The results discussed above confirm that the core B3LYP LOC approach provides high accuracy results for enthalpies of reaction, and introduce for the first time a viable model for obtaining barrier heights with this methodology. The barrier height results are comparable in accuracy to what is obtained for enthalpies of reaction, and display little fluctuation in performance across a diverse set of transition state structures and reaction chemistry. The ratio of adjustable parameters to new data points (105) is reasonable, and the parameters obtained from fitting are physically consistent with previously developed B3LYP LOC parameters for ground state thermochemistry .",PMC2808043.json,"this work describes the extension of a previously reported empirical localized orbital correction model for density functional theory (dft loc) for atomization energies, ionization potentials, electron affinities, and reaction enthalpies to the correction of barrier heights for chemical reactions of various types including cycloadditions, cycloreversions, dipolar cycloadditions, sn2s, carbon radical reactions, hydrogen radical reactions, sigmatropic shifts, and electrocyclizations. the b3lyp localized orbital correction version of the model (b3lyp loc) reduces the number of outliers and overall mean unsigned error (mue) vs. experiment or ab initio values from 3.2 to 1.3 kcal/mole for barrier heights and from 5.1 to 1.1 kcal/mole for reaction enthalpies versus b3lyp. furthermore, the new model has essentially zero additional computational cost beyond standard dft calculations. although the model is heuristic and is based on multiple linear regression to experimental or ab initio data, each of the parameters is justified on chemical grounds and provides insight into the fundamental limitations of dft, most importantly the failure of current dft methods to accurately account for nondynamical electron correlation.",0.3803418803418803,0.11587982832618025,0.24950482272811572

"Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is associated with a vast array of adverse outcomes, including cognitive deficits, impaired executive function, altered sensory function, deficits in motor functions, mental retardation, and high comorbidities with disruptive behavioral disorders .

"Familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL) is one of the most common genetic causes of hyperlipidemia (; ; ). It was first described in the Seattle Myocardial Infarction Study in 1973 , where at least 11% of individuals who were myocardial infarction (MI) survivors and less than 60 years of age had FCHL. The disease was initially characterized by variable lipoprotein phenotype (increased triglycerides, TG, and/or increased cholesterol, TC) both in the proband and in the relatives of the proband, such that these lipid levels could also vary within an individual over time.Further evaluation of 293 SNPs across this region identified a smaller region with evidence of association with apoB in family F3. Fifty two of the 293 SNPs each explained >5% of the total genetic variance, and another 10 SNPs each explained >10% of the total genetic variance .

"Advances in pain research have elucidated a great deal about the factors that may lead to chronic pain. Peripheral injury leads to increased excitability in peripheral nociceptors (peripheral sensitization) that manifests as primary hyperalgesia.

"The maternal voice is a predominant source of multimodal stimulation for the developing fetus that is largely lost for the preterm infant amidst the unfiltered levels of auditory stimuli in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). In the normal womb environment, the fetus not only hears her voice, but feels her vertebral column and diaphragm gently vibrate and move in sync with her voice. The fetus thus receives multiple forms of sensory stimulation.Future research is needed to determine whether use of safe sound levels when exposing the preterm infant to recordings of the maternal voice improve developmental outcomes. As this is done, attention to the developmental timing, or the infants age when exposure begins, is needed, particularly since the auditory and visual sensory systems are undergoing functional development during the time period infants are cared for in the NICU and the only study reviewed that reported a positive finding and reached statistical significance, provided longest duration of exposure. The studies reviewed here examined the effect of exposure to maternal voice on oxygen saturation, limb movement, heart rate, and behavioral development at 9 months of age.Preterm infants lose significant contact with their mothers voices late in prenatal development and are cared for in a hospital environment that necessitates elevated light and sound levels.

"Functional dynamics in HIV 1 TAR occurs on a timescale slower than ~10 ns, but faster than ~100 s, . These motions allow the RNA to adapt its structure to generate the conformation recognized by Tat and cyclin T1 proteins , a key regulatory checkpoint in the viral lifecycle. Dynamics occurring on the ns s time scale are invisible to conventional solution state NMR relaxation measurements because they are masked by global rotational diffusion.To construct the models, we make the assumption that the motions are composed of independent components which can be represented using multi axis models. This permits a representation of the complex motions in which local motions are represented by jumps of the principal axis system with respect to an intermediate frame, while conformational exchange jumps of the bulge residues or collective motions of the helix (which would carry the U38:A27 pair) are treated by jumps of this intermediate frame with respect to the crystal frame. Motions of the C D bond vector are then described by two successive independent transformations, where one set of angles describes the local motion and a second set describes the motions of the intermediate frame, representing a conformational exchange motion in each model .The essential functional dynamics of TAR RNA occur on a timescale (ns s) that is invisible to current solution relaxation NMR techniques, and that is also too fast to be studied by relaxation dispersion.

"A number of different subcortical pathways of visual information originate from different classes of retinal ganglion cells and remain spatially segregated in the subcortex, while being recombined in the visual cortex. The major pathways include the superior colliculus (SC) and the magnocellular (M) and parvocellular (P) parts of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). These subcortical visual nuclei occupy central positions within the recurrent architecture of the visual system and may act as important control structures in directing and sustaining spatial attention.Five subjects participated in the study, which was approved by the Institutional Review Panel of Princeton University. All subjects (20 35 years old, one male) were in good health with no past history of psychiatric or neurological disorders and gave their informed written consent.

"Vestibular evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) testing is currently being utilized in the assessment of a variety of vestibular etiologies. The VEMP response is obtained by measuring the release of the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle from a contracted state provoked by delivering auditory stimuli to the ipsilateral ear . VEMP responses are considered to be a reflection of vestibulospinal projections to the neck, which give rise to information regarding saccule and inferior vestibular nerve integrity .Forty six normal controls ranging between 20 and 76 (mean 44.2) years of age participated in the research study.

"The Akt (PKB) signaling plays important roles in the heart by balancing cell survival and programmed cell death, and thereby influences cardiac function . Akt is activated by stress and extracellular signals that activate phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K) through interaction with tyrosine kinase receptors. Activated PI3K catalyzes phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2) to generate phosphoinositide 3 (PIP3) .Activation of PH domain Leucine Rich Protein Phosphatase 2 (PHLPP2) by Agonist Stimulation in Cardiac Myocytes Expressing Adenylyl Cyclase Type 6 19450723 PHLPP, members of PP2C family phosphatases, have been showed that dephosphorylate Akt at Ser473 and attenuates Akt signaling []. In vitro studies showed that only 10% Akt activity came from single phosphorylation event at Thr308 and maximal Akt activation required phosphorylation at both Ser473 and Thr308 sites . Thus, phosphorylation of Ser473 controls the activity of Akt.The present study demonstrates that PHLPP2 activity was suppressed by increased AC6 in cardiac myocytes through their protein protein interaction, which resulted in high levels of Akt phosphorylation. However, AC6 inhibited PHLPP2 was rapidly activated by isoproterenol and forskolin stimulation, which led to marked dephosphorylation of Akt at Ser473, but not Thr308.

"A persistent impairment in joint attention is now widely recognized as a distinctive manifestation of autism . A burgeoning literature supports this claim with convincing demonstrations that toddlers with autism spectrum disorders display marked deficits in joint attention skills during standardized assessments , and rarely engage in periods of shared engagement that entail coordinating attention to both social partners and a shared topic during social interactions . This disruption of coordinated joint engagement may reflect underlying core deficits such as a tendency not to look at faces or difficulty integrating gaze with gestures and vocalizations that constitute an early distinctive feature of autism .For both coding systems, two separate video recordings were made, synchronized with a common vertical interval time code (VITC; ). This procedure allowed coders to view either recording, whichever provided the better view, while preserving a common time code for data recording. For coding engagement states, teams, each comprised of two coders, viewed the recordings of each scene and identified seams or breakpoints in the stream of behavior between different engagement states, using the eleven code options described earlier.This studys findings provide ample support for the contention that young childrens level of interest in people and in objects may contribute to crucial variations in their experiences during interactions with their caregivers. As we anticipated, early differences in childrens interests in people and in objects are relatively stable, and they are moderated in conceptually reasonable and informative ways by autism and by Down syndrome. Moreover, interests predict not only how often a child will sustain periods of coordinated joint engagement during caregiver child play but also how rapidly symbols will infuse joint engagement .",PMC2873143.json,"this study examines how spontaneous interests in people and in objects relate to joint engagement in typically developing toddlers and young children with autism or down syndrome. ratings of interests were made repeatedly during intermissions in a laboratory based protocol focused on caregiver child interactions. interests were moderated by diagnosis and relatively stable across intermissions. in autism, interest in people tended to be low and to decline rapidly, and the balance of interests favored familiar objects over people. lower interest in people and in unfamiliar objects was associated with less coordinated joint engagement and with less steep developmental trajectories for symbol infused joint engagement. these findings suggest that variations in interests may contribute to differences in the childs engagement during social interactions that facilitate the acquisition of language.",0.40499999999999997,0.15075376884422112,0.21918322869580573

"Arrest is an important indicator of status in American society. Traditionally, arrest experiences have been viewed negatively,invoking a diminished social status (e.g., it negatively affects one in the marriage market and in the employment sphere; see [, ]).

"Many investigators have embraced a model in which frailty represents a state of decreased physiological reserves and dysregulation of multiple physiological systems. In 2001, Fried et al. used data from the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) and defined a phenotype of frailty that included three or more of the following: weight loss, weak grip, exhaustion, slow gait, and low physical activity level. A subsequent study used latent class analyses in the Womens Health and Aging Study to demonstrate that the selected dichotomized CHS criteria occur together across individuals.A series of logistic regression models was constructed to quantify the relationship between each frailty phenotype and PCA identified subdimension and two outcomes: disability by 1995 and mortality by 2000.

"Glucocorticoids (CORT) are hormones that respond to stress by coordinating diverse physiological processes aimed at maintaining homeostasis,. Many lines of evidence indicate that prolonged secretion of glucocorticoids during chronic stress disrupts learning and memory, but transient release at the time of learning may promote it. Notably, under normal physiological conditions, glucocorticoid activity oscillates in synchrony with circadian rhythms: diurnal peaks and troughs are closely coupled with the active and inactive phases of the circadian cycle,.Methods and any associated references are available in the online version of the paper . Circadian glucocorticoid oscillations promote learning dependent synapse formation and maintenance Although the results above highlight the importance of the circadian glucocorticoid peak in experience dependent spine formation, it is not known whether the circadian glucocorticoid oscillation influences spine maintenance. Learning related new spines are initially highly unstable: most new spines will be pruned within days after their formation, but a subset will be selectively stabilized over time, and most of those that survive will contain functional synapses,.Experience dependent dendritic spine remodeling involves two distinct processes: first, learning induces spine formation, and subsequently, a fraction of new spines is selectively stabilized and a subset of pre existing spines is pruned,. We began by investigating how circadian glucocorticoid oscillations might affect the process of spine formation in a rotarod motor skill learning model.

"Among the many proteins and metabolites secreted by adipocytes, adiponectin serves a unique role as a salutary, antidiabetic, insulin sensitizing factor that has antiatherogenic and anti inflammatory properties in the vasculature. Numerous epidemiological studies have shown that reduced adiponectin levels correlate with increased risk of cardiovascular disease in obese individuals and in patients with diabetes and hyperglycemia. These high risk patients also have increased concentrations of circulating cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF).Protective vascular and myocardial effects of adiponectin 19029992 In metabolic diseases such as diabetes and obesity, inflammation of the systemic microcirculation is widely appreciated to underlie organ damage and other chronic complications. Consistent with the epidemiologic association of reduced adiponectin levels in patients who are obese and in those who have type 2 diabetes, in vitro studies have shown that adiponectin can reverse the deleterious endothelial effects of TNF and other cytokines, as well as high glucose levels,, which trigger an inflammatory signaling cascade, enhance leukocyte endothelial interactions and, therefore, lead to some of the early processes of atherosclerosis . The microvascular inflammation observed in Adipoq /  mice is thus consistent with the development of cardiovascular complications in individuals with diminished circulating levels of adiponectin, as shown in many epidemiological studies noted above.Adiponectin is an abundant, oligomeric protein secreted from adipose tissue, which exhibits a variety of remarkable salutary responses that affect insulin resistance and vascular inflammation. The varied responses in multiple tissue types involve different signal transduction pathways; notably the AMP kinase and the PKA cascades in the endothelium, as well as AMP kinase and COX 2 signaling in cardiomyocytes. The resultant cellular effects of adiponectin include enhanced NO production, and inhibition of ROS and inflammatory NFB signaling in the vasculature, as well as reduced MIR injury with suppression of TNF signaling, reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and suppression of oxidative and nitrative stress.",PMC2658652.json,"summary adiponectin is an abundant plasma protein secreted from adipocytes that elicits protective effects in the vasculature and myocardium. in obesity and insulin resistant states, adiponectin levels are reduced and loss of its protective effects might contribute to the excess cardiovascular risk observed in these conditions. adiponectin ameliorates the progression of macrovascular disease in rodent models, consistent with its correlation with improved vascular outcomes in epidemiological studies. the mechanisms of adiponectin signaling are multiple and vary among its cellular sites of action. in endothelial cells, adiponectin enhances production of nitric oxide, suppresses production of reactive oxygen species, and protects cells from inflammation that results from exposure to high glucose levels or tumor necrosis factor, through activation of amp activated protein kinase and cyclic amp dependent protein kinase (also known as protein kinase a) signaling cascades. in the myocardium, adiponectin mediated protection from ischemia reperfusion injury is linked to cyclo oxygenase 2 mediated suppression of tumor necrosis factor signaling, inhibition of apoptosis by amp activated protein kinase, and inhibition of excess peroxynitrite induced oxidative and nitrative stress. in this review, we provide an update of studies of the signaling effects of adiponectin in endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes.",0.4820717131474104,0.13999999999999999,0.2702341455899124
"In cancer, progressive illness leads to an increased involvement of family members as caregivers and, ultimately, decision makers Because more cancer patients receive their treatment in outpatient rather than in patient settings, care of cancer patients falls increasingly on the shoulders of patients' families .

"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor impairments, including rigidity, tremor, bradykinesia, and postural instability. These motor symptoms have been primarily attributed to the progressive degeneration of dopamine (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra and a concomitant loss of striatal DA (; ; ; ) . The motor symptoms of PD are treated by dopamine replacement therapy (DRT) with administration of either L 3,4 dihydroxyphenylalanine (levodopa) or direct dopamine agonists.Separate groups of untreated animals were used to determine the effects of MPTP treatment on regional monoamine concentrations. Animals were sacrificed three weeks after saline or MPTP administration. This is the same time point that the behavioral studies were performed.Levodopa is arguably the most effective treatment for PD, but patients invariably develop motor fluctuations and dyskinesias with chronic treatment (; ; ; ; ). Treatment with direct DA agonists also causes dyskinesias, although there may be a longer interval between initiation of treatment and emergence of dyskinesias with agonists. Thus, although dopamine replacement therapy is remarkably effective in the treatment of idiopathic PD, the side effect liabilities of dopaminergic agents suggest that drugs that modulate the activity of striatal medium spiny neurons may be a useful strategy to improve motor function, perhaps with lower side effect liability.",PMC2878885.json,"clinical observations have suggested that ritanserin, a 5 ht2a/c receptor antagonist may reduce motor deficits in persons with parkinson's disease (pd). to better understand the potential antiparkinsonian actions of ritanserin, we compared the effects of ritanserin with the selective 5 ht2a receptor antagonist m100907 and the selective 5 ht2c receptor antagonist sb on motor impairments in mice treated with 1 methyl 4 phenyl 1,2,3,6 tetrahydropyridine (mptp). mptp treated mice exhibited decreased performance on the beam walking apparatus. these motor deficits were reversed by acute treatment with l 3,4 dihydroxyphenylalanine (levodopa). both the mixed 5 ht2a/c antagonist ritanserin and the selective 5 ht2a antagonist m100907 improved motor performance on the beam walking apparatus. in contrast, sb was ineffective in improving the motor deficits in mptp treated mice. these data suggest that 5 ht2a receptor antagonists may represent a novel approach to ameliorate motor symptoms of parkinson's disease.",0.319327731092437,0.09577464788732394,0.2328129025732604

To assess the detectability of ncMRI signal, several groups have simulated the MRI signal change produced by ncMRI effects using simplified current dipole (SCD) models (,), which depict the neuronal currents as static current dipoles with simple alignment (e.g., parallel or antiparallel) .shows maximum ncMRI magnitude and phase signal changes at TE = 50 ms for different firing neuron densities (FN). The maximum signal changes refer to the maximum values that can be achieved with all possible B0 directions and voxel positions. It is found that the amplitude of ncMRI signal increases with the increase in FN, and there is an approximately linear relationship between the ncMRI signal change and FN.In conclusion, we established a realistic ncMRI model for human brain tissue. It is found that the intensity of ncMRI signal highly relies on the density of firing neurons and imaging conditions such as TE, the direction of B0 relative to the tissue surface, and position of voxel in the direction of tissue thickness. The results indicated that the ncMRI magnitude and phase signals evoked by physiological stimulation are too weak to be detected in human subjects.",PMC3097305.json,"up to date, no consensus has been achieved regarding the possibility of detecting neuronal currents by mri (ncmri) in human brain. to evaluate the detectability of ncmri, an effective way is to simulate ncmri signal with the realistic neuronal geometry and electrophysiological processes. unfortunately, previous realistic ncmri models are based on rat and monkey neurons. the species difference in neuronal morphology and physiology would prevent these models from simulating the ncmri signal accurately in human subjects. the aim of the present study is to bridge this gap by establishing a realistic ncmri model specifically for human cerebral cortex. in this model, the ncmri signal was simulated using anatomically reconstructed human pyramidal neurons and their biophysical properties. the modeling results showed that the amplitude of ncmri signal significantly depends on the density of synchronously firing neurons and imaging conditions such as position of imaging voxel, direction of main magnetic field (b0) relative to the cortical surface and echo time. the results indicated that physiologically evoked ncmri signal is too weak to be detected (magnitude/phase change 1.4106/0.02), but the phase signal induced by spontaneous activity may reach a detectable level (up to 0.2) in favorable conditions.",0.5794392523364488,0.2488262910798122,0.394201776268882
"Yearly cases of ILI in acute care settings throughout the U.S. are reported to public health and attributed to influenza virus, mostly Flu A with some Flu B.

"Researchers often have found that, relative to neutral information, emotional information can attract attention more rapidly and also enhance memory strength. This prioritization of mental resources toward processing emotional information can lead to enhancements in memory for emotional information, and for its associated context [reviewed by ; ; e.g., flashbulb memories, , emotional words, ]. However, it also can come at a cost for attending to and later remembering neutral peripheral or contextual information in visual images containing emotional items (; ; ; ) (reviewed by , but see for circumstances of item and contextual memory enhancement).The stimulus set included 272 emotional items, 136 neutral items, and 300 backgrounds. Scenes included an emotional or neutral item placed onto a background. The stimulus set was comprised of items and scenes from prior studies (, , ), those gathered from photo clipart packages (Hemera Technologies Inc., 2002, Canada), and from the International Affective Picture System [IAPS ].Though it often has been argued that trade offs in memory for emotional scenes are the result of encoding related processes, this study is the first to provide direct evidence of a link between the encoding processes engaged during scene processing and the likelihood of a tradeoff in memory. The present study makes clear that there can be enhanced memory for an emotional focus at the expense of memory for the background context, and that the existence of this memory trade off can be related to activity elicited during encoding. The present results also reveal that key emotional memory regions such as the amygdala, hippocampus, fusiform, temporal pole, and inferior frontal gyrus, are commonly active for the trade off among the range of emotional scene types, but that the exact pattern of neural activity corresponding with this effect varies with a scenes valence and arousal properties.",PMC3100422.json,"often memory for emotionally arousing items is enhanced relative to neutral items within complex visual scenes, but this enhancement can come at the expense of memory for peripheral background information. this trade off effect has been elicited by a range of stimulus valence and arousal levels, yet the magnitude of the effect has been shown to vary with these factors. using fmri, this study investigated the neural mechanisms underlying this selective memory for emotional scenes. further, we examined how these processes are affected by stimulus dimensions of arousal and valence. the trade off effect in memory occurred for low to high arousal positive and negative scenes. there was a core emotional memory network associated with the trade off among all the emotional scene types, however there were additional regions that were uniquely associated with the trade off for each individual scene type. these results suggest that there is a common network of regions associated with the emotional memory tradeoff effect, but that valence and arousal also independently affect the neural activity underlying the effect.",0.4741379310344827,0.13852813852813853,0.28885340811888693
"The kynurenine pathway (KP) is the primary mode of L tryptophan catabolism in mammalian tissues, responsible for 95% of L tryptophan degradation . Though chiefly carried out to yield the ubiquitous coenzymes nicotine adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and nicotine adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) for use in basic cellular processes, the KP plays additional roles in cellular, particularly neuronal, physiology . Notably, L tryptophan is an essential amino acid, and thus must be retrieved in the diet.Using Case Western Reserve University IRB approved protocols, brain samples were collected at the time of autopsy. Hippocampal sections from cases of pathologically confirmed AD (n= 12; age 69 96 yr, mean 84  8.2 yr) and from young (n= 3; age 31 54 yr, mean 42  11.5 yr) and age matched (n= 7; age 66 86 yr, mean 71.5  6.8 yr) controls were collected, fixed in methacarn (methanol: chloroform: acetic acid; 6:3:1), and embedded in paraffin. Sections (6 m) were cut and processed for immunohistochemistry using the peroxidase anti peroxidase method.The elevated expression of both 3 HK modifications and IDO 1 in AD tissue sections confirms the upregulation of the kynurenine pathway in AD.

"In spite of being developed more than 100 years ago by Camillo Golgi, and popularized by Santiago Ramon y Cajal, the Golgi method is still a very useful and widely used technique that reveals the fine structure of neurons, glia and their processes, both in the normal and pathological nervous system. The descriptions of neurons as we know them today were possible thanks to the use of this impregnation technique developed more than 100 years ago. One of the fine structures that were first revealed by the use of the Golgi method and that caught the eye of Santiago Ramon y Cajal were the dendritic spines.After the samples were thawed or subjected to the different pretreatments, they were immersed in the chromation solution which consists of a mixture of mercury chloride + potassium dichromate + potassium chromate, following the instructions of the manufacturer. The chromation solution was replaced after the first 12 hours, and the samples were kept in the fresh solution in the dark for 2 or 3 weeks in the case of rat brain, or 3 weeks in the case of human brain. Brain samples were then transferred to a cryoprotectant solution and kept at 4C for a minimum of 1 week, replacing the cryoprotectant solution after the first 48 hours.Here we report for the first time the validity of the use of an old impregnation technique for the study of human and animal brain tissue that has been stored frozen for long periods of time. Our results show that Golgi Cox impregnation of frozen human or animal brain tissue is suitable for the analysis of certain parameters such as dendrite length and branching pattern, dendrite spine counts and the analysis of dendritic spine morphology. This analysis can be performed currently in a more reliable and accurate manner with the use of motorized microscopes that allow the performance of stacks of micrographs in the Z axis (basic for the three dimensional reconstruction of neurons) in combination with software applications for the quantification of such parameters in the resulting micrographs (see i.e. Garcia Lopez et al., 2006) .",PMC2637610.json,"the study of dendritic spine shape and number has become a standard in the analysis of synaptic transmission anomalies since a considerable number of neuropsychiatric and neurological diseases have their foundation in alterations in these structures. one of the best ways to study possible alterations of dendritic spines is the use of golgi impregnation. although usually the golgi method implies the use of fresh or fixed tissue, here we report the use of golgi cox for the staining of human and animal brain tissue kept frozen for long periods of time. we successfully applied the golgi cox method to human brain tissue stored for up to years in a freezer. the technique produced reliable and reproducible impregnation of dendrites and dendritic spines in different cortical areas. we also applied the same technique to rat brain frozen for up to one year, obtaining the same satisfactory results. the fact that golgi cox can be successfully applied to this type of tissue adds a new value for hundreds of frozen human or animal brains kept in the freezers of the laboratories, that otherwise would not be useful for anything else. researchers other than neuroanatomists, i.e. in fields such as biochemistry and molecular biology can also benefit from a simple and reliable technique that can be applied to tissue left from their primary experiments.",0.4658493870402802,0.18629173989455186,0.29237025183400855

"Bariatric or metabolic surgery is one of the accepted therapeutic options to treat type 2 diabetes in individuals with severe obesity (BMI > 35/m2) . Roux en Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is one of the recommended surgeries to induce remission of type 2 diabetes mellitus in obese individuals , , with estimates of cumulative remission rates of approximately 60% at three years following surgery , .

For each combination of parameter values, denoted candidate parameter sets, we simulated the clinically observable counts (COCs) of both observed remission and total attrition in the simulated population.

The mechanism of action of droxidopa is somewhat unique: It is a prodrug that is converted to norepinephrine by l aromatic amino acid decarboxylase.We performed a retrospective review of patients who had been treated with droxidopa at Vanderbilt Medical Center, an academic tertiary care center in Nashville, Tennessee, between November 2014 and January 2018. Based on pharmacy records, we identified 101 patients who initiated droxidopa therapy during this time period. We then performed a comprehensive chart review for each patient, including analysis of droxidopa titration schedule and dosing, medical comorbidities, clinical course, and outcome.We identified six patients who developed cognitive and behavioral symptoms, including mania, irritability, and disorientation, shortly after the initiation of droxidopa for neurogenic orthostatic hypotension.

"Although 131I orthoiodohippuran (131I OIH) has excellent pharmacokinetic properties as a renal tracer, its use has been compromised because of the suboptimal imaging characteristics of the 364 keV photon of 131I and the delivery of relatively high radiation doses to kidney and thyroid in patients with impaired renal function . The limitations of 131I OIH led to the introduction of 99mTc mercaptoacetyltriglycine (99mTc MAG3) as a 99mTc replacement for 131I OIH in 1986 .

"Prenatal cocaine exposure has subtle effects on developing systems responsible for reactivity in response to stress and regulation of arousal . Cocaine is known to inhibit the reuptake of monoamines at the presynaptic junction, leading to higher concentrations of norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine in the synaptic cleft and higher levels of activation in the catecholaminergic systems . Chronic prenatal cocaine exposure is also associated with reduced metabolic activity in the meso cortical limbic system (e.g., ).At 7 months, infant reactivity and regulation were assessed in three different behavioral paradigms designed to induce affect that were taken from the Laboratory Temperament Assessment Battery (LabTAB; ). These included the arm restraint paradigm designed to elicit anger/frustration, a puppet show to elicit positive affect, and presentation of four different scary masks to elicit fear.

"Neuroimaging research on age related changes in brain function has focused nearly exclusively on task related activation (, ). Several forms of evidence, however, suggest that decreases in brain activity (i.e., deactivation) are also informative measures. Research with younger adults has demonstrated that the level of the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is lower, in some brain regions, during a cognitive task than during a resting or baseline condition.There are several limitations to the present research, related to both the measurement of FC and the analysis of adult age differences. As noted previously in this Discussion, although our method does not require a priori assumptions regarding the location of the relevant brain regions, the anatomical template may not be as sensitive as a voxelwise approach for detecting FC, particularly when the voxel wise connectivity levels within an anatomical region are not homogeneous. In addition, the present sample size, 19 participants in each of two age groups, limits the statistical power to detect both regional FC and age related change.We have demonstrated a data processing approach for identifying age group differences in behaviorally relevant, intrinsic FC, independently of age group differences in functional connectivity strength.

"The sport of ice climbing is increasing in popularity among outdoor recreationists. In 2005, an estimated one million Americans participated in ice climbing a 42% increase from 2003 . As little as 30 years ago, only hardy outdoorsmen climbed ice.Estimating the Economic Value of Ice Climbing in Hyalite Canyon: An Application of Travel Cost Count Data Models that Account for Excess Zeros* 20044202 In the single site travel cost model, the individuals utility is a function of a basket of market goods (x), trips to the recreation site (m), and site quality (q) (1)u=u(x,m,q).Utility is maximized subject to a budget and time constraint (2)wL=x+popm(3)T=L+tm where L is work hours, w is the wage rate, pop is out of pocket trip expenditures, T is the total time available, and t is the travel time of a trip. This maximization problem yields a demand function for trips (4)m=m(Y,pTC,q) where pTC = pOP + wt is the full price of a trip and Y = wT is income. Specifying demand as log linear and abstracting from changing site quality, can be rewritten as (5)m=exp(+TCpTC+YY).If access to the recreation site were closed, then the individual would lose her entire consumer surplus from taking positive trips.This paper contributes to the recreation demand literature by considering a novel application of the travel cost method and by studying a site that is currently surrounded by access controversy. Most importantly, the results above indicate that large economic benefits exist from land being used for ice climbing. In the context of Hyalite Canyon, these benefits are estimated upwards of $76 per person per trip and $480 per year for the average individual.",PMC2819565.json,"recently, the sport of ice climbing has seen a drastic increase in popularity. this paper uses the travel cost method to estimate the demand for ice climbing in hyalite canyon, montana, one of the premier ice climbing venues in north america. access to hyalite and other ice climbing destinations have been put at risk due to liability issues, public land management agendas, and winter road conditions. to this point, there has been no analysis on the economic benefits of ice climbing. in addition to the novel outdoor recreation application, this study applies econometric methods designed to deal with excess zeros in the data. depending upon model specification, per person per trip values are estimated to be in the range of $76 to $135.",0.3645083932853717,0.15903614457831325,0.23422242888279918

We conclude that the addition of bupivacaine or silver sulfadiazine to sIPN does not affect healing of partial thickness wounds in our animal model compared to sIPN alone.There were overall no differences in the structures and cells associated with wound healing have been observed among treatment types. All treatments elicited healing without outstanding, untoward effects. We found that the different dressings elicited distinct histological features throughout the course of healing.",PMC2924184.json,"introduction previously, we have shown in a cross comparison study that multifunctional photopolymerized semi interpenetrating network (sipn) system is an effective donor site treatment in a swine model. the advantages of sipn include spray on application, in situ photopolymerization, and ability to cover large contoured areas. sipn has also been shown to be an effective delivery vehicle for keratinocyte growth factor, dexamethasone, bupivacaine, and silver sulfadiazine in vitro. our aim for this study was to show that these products delivered to the wound bed with sipn would not change the wound healing characteristics compared to the control site through qualitative clinical evaluation and to compare the rate and quality of donor site healing through histologic evaluation. methods eight yucatan swine of 40lbs each were randomly divided into four groups of two pigs prior to surgery. each animal had 5.6 % total body surface area of skin harvested from two different dorsal regions, with one at 22/1000th inch and the other at 30/1000th inch setting on the dermatome. each test site on each animal was then sequentially dressed with cm2 of xeroform gauze, sipn, sipn loaded with 0.5% bupivacaine, or sipn loaded with 1% silver sulfadiazine. sipn with or without soluble drugs were applied as liquid then photopolymerized in situ to form an elastic covering. each of the test areas was separated by cm2 of autograft which was used to divide the test areas. wound assessment and euthanasia occurred at days 7, 9, 14, and days. a full thickness biopsy was taken from each of the study areas for histological analysis. results by days, all areas show complete epidermal coverage histologically. the 30/1000th inch site revealed a thicker, more irregular dermis compared to the 22/1000th site. evaluation of the day sites revealed equal thinning and flattening of the new epidermis. no site showed full restoration of the rete ridges. no signs of infection were seen in clinical or histological evaluations of any treatment. conclusion the addition of bupivacaine and silver sulfadiazine to sipn does not show any alterations in wound healing of a donor site in a swine model when compared with sipn without loaded drugs and a standard control dressing. this efficacy may be coupled with established localized sipn drug delivery profiles and allow further studies to evaluate the efficacy of these drugs to promote healing, eradicate and prevent infection, and manage pain.",0.4057507987220447,0.125,0.22524144942493562

Testing day order was counterbalanced across participants but stratified by race and sex.Suprathreshold electric stimulus intensity (in mA) was individually calibrated to each participant prior to CPM testing. Because NFR magnitudes were a dependent variable in the current study, it was important to ensure that NFRs were reliably evoked throughout CPM testing.

"Alzheimers Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition in which impairments of episodic memory are an early hallmark symptom. Memory loss is likely driven, in part, by the well described early neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology in the medial temporal lobe (MTL), the central anatomic structure supporting episodic memory (; ; ). While measurements of the hippocampus have proven to be one of the most reliable biomarkers of AD, both for prediction of cognitive decline in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and for tracking disease progression, more granular measurement of MTL substructures may prove to enhance sensitivity at different disease stages  .In addition to examining group statistics, we also calculated absolute percent change in volume and thickness across the spectrum of AD relative to normal aging. This cross sectional, pseudo longitudinal analysis is akin to the inference that Braak and Braak originally used to stage temporal ordering of NFT deposition in autopsy data . Our findings do appear to qualitatively match the expected pattern of regional involvement.There are two primary findings from the current work. The first is that more granular measurement of MTL subregions provides enhanced sensitivity to early stages of AD compared to whole hippocampal measurements. The second is that the pattern of atrophy within the MTL associated with different degrees of AD severity, from preclinical to dementia, generally recapitulates the topographic pattern of NFT deposition reported in the histology literature.",PMC5154888.json,"autopsy studies of alzheimers disease (ad) have found that neurofibrillary tangle (nft) pathology of the medial temporal lobe (mtl) demonstrates selective topography with relatively stereotyped subregional involvement at early disease stages, prompting interest in more granular measurement of these structures with in vivo mri. we applied a novel, automated method for measurement of hippocampal subfields and extrahippocampal mtl cortical regions. the cohort included cognitively normal (cn) adults (n=86), early mild cognitive impairment (emci; n=43), late mci (lmci; n=22), and mild ad (n=40) patients from the alzheimers disease neuroimaging initiative (adni). for pseudolongitudinal analysis of the continuum from preclinical to mild ad dementia, the groups were further divided according to amyloid status based on pet. specific subregions associated with the early nft pathology of ad were more sensitive to preclinical and early prodromal ad than whole hippocampal volume while more diffuse involvement was found in later stages. in particular, ba35, the first region associated with nft deposition, was the only region to discriminate preclinical ad from amyloid negative cn adults (normal aging). in general, patterns of atrophy in the pseudolongitudinal analysis largely recapitulated braak staging of nfts within the mtl.",0.5083135391923991,0.17183770883054894,0.2868007386157312
"The assembly of guanine base repeats in tetrads around central cations results in the formation of higher order DNA structures known as quadruplexes. Quadruplexes have been studied extensively due to their role in halting both the immortalization of cells and tumor growth by preventing the binding of telomerase, a key enzyme responsible for the elongation of DNA.() Bases other than guanine are also capable of forming higher order DNA structures including triplexes, quadruplexes, and pentaplexes.Both G9 and Ig9 were annealed in a similar manner. The strands and appropriate salts at concentrations described in the text were placed in a hot water bath and cooled to room temperature overnight (approximately 12 hours). The concentration of the single strands during annealing was approximately 100125M.Quadruplexes and pentaplexes of G9 and Ig9, respectively, were annealed in solutions containing cations of varying charge and ionic radius. The formation of G9 quadruplexes was far more dependent on the identity of the central cation than the formation of Ig9 complexes.

"Acute HIV infection (AHI), the weeks to about two months between acquisition of HIV and completion of seroconversion, is characterized by high grade viremia, negative or indeterminate antibody tests, and for most people, a constellation of ""flu like"" symptoms . AHI is a period of heightened infectiousness, meaning that individuals with AHI are at their most infectious during a time when, by routine HIV antibody test, they may believe themselves uninfected. Furthermore, although acute HIV shedding is over about ten weeks post infection, elevated onward transmission likely extends through the period of early infection (the six month period after seroconversion) due to ongoing high risk behaviors, associated sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) that increase transmission risk, and transmission amplification through high risk sexual and drug use networks.Most respondents reported significant confusion about the series of tests that led to their diagnosis.

"Alkanes are an important class of compounds with a variety of commercial and industrial uses, such as in petroleum refining, as industrial solvents, and in a wide range of products including oils and cosmetics[, ]. Aliphatic groups are also widely present in organic and biological systems; therefore, accurate representations of alkanes and aliphatic groups are desirable towards the goal of efficient molecular modeling of such systems. Another consideration is the treatment of electrostatic interactions in molecular simulations; traditionally, atoms are assigned fixed charges which interact via a Coulomb potential.Revised Charge Equilibration Parameters for More Accurate Hydration Free Energies of Alkanes 20161648 Next, we consider the water alkane interactions as measured by the radial distribution function (RDF). For all systems, we have calculated the RDFs for water oxygen to alkane carbons using both the original model and our revised model. The system of a single alkane molecule with 256 TIP4P FQ waters was simulated for ~ 5 ns for each alkane to obtain these results, shown in .We have presented a revised set of nonbonded parameters for our CHEQ alkane force field.

"Chronic pain is often associated with poor quality of life, negative affect, and functional impairment. For example, in a recent sample of chronic low back pain patients recruited from primary care clinics (n=423), 22% reported clinically relevant depressive symptoms and 54% reported significant functional impairment . Many chronic pain patients also report sleep disturbance.The results of zero order correlation analyses indicated that preconditions for testing mediation were met for all associations between sleep disturbance and the chronic pain and functional outcomes. Results of the first series of mediation analyses testing whether the association between sleep disturbance and chronic pain intensity was mediated by psychosocial status (with each potential mediator tested in a separate model) are summarized in . Significant indirect effects of sleep disturbance on all three chronic pain intensity outcomes via depression levels (BDI) were observed (i.e., the bootstrap confidence intervals did not include zero).Evidence strongly suggests that sleep disturbance, chronic pain intensity, and functional impairment are related, either directly and/or via intermediate factors.

"The World Health Organization recently reported that tobacco use could contribute to the deaths of one billion people in the 21st century . Despite this sobering statistic, relapse rates remain high for smokers attempting to quit (; ; ). During a smoking cessation attempt, most relapse episodes occur following exposure to smoking cues .On average, subjects had an attentional bias score of 23.3  67.5ms; critically, the range was wide (from 164 to 57.5 ms), corroborating the use of a correlational approach. HAMD scores were in the normal range 2.4  2.4 indicating no current depressive symptoms. FTND scores were 5.6  2.2, indicating nicotine dependence.The main finding emerging from the current study is that attentional bias toward smoking related words was positively correlated with greater brain reactivity to smoking versus neutral images in brain regions involved in memory, emotion, interoception, and visual spatial processing. The correlations may indicate that regions supporting these processes are part of the neural substrate of smoking stimulus attentional bias .

"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a cell receptor known to be amplified in a large percentage of cancers, 55% by some estimates, and contributes to malignant cell proliferation when activated via binding by an associated ligand, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF)( ). Shutting down this pathway to halt malignant proliferation has been the subject of many research and drug development efforts in recent years and several EGFR targeted therapies are now commonly used against some forms of cancer; however, the ability to image EGFR activity has not been widely examined in a way which would translate to human use. The pre clinical study reported here examines the diagnostic potential of MRI coupled fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT) to determine EGFR status between two different brain tumor cell lines; U251 (human glioma) and 9L GFP (rat gliosarcoma transfected with green fluorescent protein).Fifteen animals were included in this MRI FMT study, six with U251 tumors, five with 9L GFP tumors, and four tumor free controls. All procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Prior to imaging, each nude mouse underwent intracranial surgery during which tumor cells were implanted in the animal's brain.MRI guided fluorescence tomography demonstrated excellent diagnostic capability between EGFR(+) and EGFR( ) tumor lines and between EGFR(+) and control animals in vivo. Differences in fluorescence yield corresponding to Gd enhanced regions in the brain were statistically significant between EGFR(+) and EGFR( ) tumor lines and between EGFR(+) and control animals, even though the sample sizes in each group were relatively small.

"The initial structural characterization in 1991 [, ] of the rhodopsin like receptor for C5a, C5aR , and the receptor for N formyl Met Leu Phe provided key biochemical information that would permit development of antibodies and synthetic inhibitors to these receptors, for which C5aR binds C5a with high affinity and initiates G protein dependent cascade of cell responses (increased intracellular Ca2+, granule fusion with the cell membrane, enzyme release, on oxidative burst [H2O2 production], etc.). Similar signaling events occur with receptorligand interaction involving the formyl peptide receptor. C5aR is now known to be crucial in the initiation of acute inflammatory responses [, ].10.1007/s00109 009 0442 7 Between 2002 and 2005, C5L2 was described as having the ability to bind with C3a des Arg with high affinity [].

What is confusing is the extent to which C3a and C3a des Arg bind to C5L2. It is also known that C5aR interacts with C5a in a G protein dependent manner, which results in increased intracellular Ca2+ together with MAPK and Akt activation, followed by a series of functional responses such as chemotaxis, enzyme release, Mac 1 upregulation, degranulation, a respiratory burst, etc.",PMC2754833.json,"the split product of the complement protein, c5, is c5a and is an extremely potent pro inflammatory peptide that interacts with two c5a receptors, c5ar and c5l2, present on surfaces of phagocytes as well as other cell types. the former is a well established receptor that initiates g protein coupled signaling via mitogen activated protein kinase pathways. its in vivo blockade greatly reduces inflammatory injury. much less is known about c5l2, occupancy of which by c5a does not initiate increased intracellular ca2+. there are numerous conflicting reports suggesting that c5l2 is a default receptor that attenuates c5a dependent biological responses by competing with c5ar for binding of c5a. however, there are other reports suggesting that c5l2 plays an active, positive role in inflammatory responses. better definition of c5l2 is needed if its in vivo blockade, along with c5ar, is to be considered in complement dependent inflammatory diseases.",0.37054631828978624,0.09069212410501194,0.19847205471177662
"Enrolling children in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) presents a conflict between societys interests in protecting children from research risks and its interest in fostering optimal pediatric care. Because research risks are often unforeseen, particularly when studying novel interventions, doctrines of research ethics have long held that such interventions should be tested in adults first (, ). This paradigm has undoubtedly spared some children from the adverse consequences of interventions that proved unexpectedly hazardous.No child left behind: Enrolling children and adults simultaneously in critical care randomized trials* 19602971 Simultaneous enrollment of children and adults in critical care RCTs might entail enrolling children as a prespecified subgroup within a larger trial of adults, or enrolling children in a separate but parallel trial. There are at least two benefits to enrolling adults and children in the same RCT. First, doing so could reduce overall research costs by enabling investigators to use the same data collection and management infrastructures for each subgroup.Simultaneously enrolling children and adults in RCTs of novel critical care interventions is an ethical way to improve the care of critically ill children. Using the methods discussed in this essay, investigators may more rapidly produce definitive pediatric evidence while at the same time minimizing the overall number of children exposed to research. We therefore recommend changing the default paradigm for pediatric research so as to better respect childrens rights to have their care guided by the same high quality evidence as adults presently have .",PMC2903616.json,"objective randomized clinical trials of novel critical care interventions are currently tested in children only after documenting their safety in adults. although this practice may protect children from research risks, it may paradoxically threaten childrens well being by depriving them of evidence to guide their care. we sought to evaluate the ethical, methodologic, and practical arguments for and against studying critical care interventions in adults and children simultaneously rather than sequentially. data source empirical studies and conceptual arguments germane to the objective were reviewed. data extraction and synthesis children are traditionally viewed as participants of last resort due to their vulnerability and decisional incapacity. however, critically ill adults commonly share similar features. thus, structured risk assessments used by institutional review boards to determine the adequacy of research protections for critically ill adults can also help protect children. from a methodologic perspective, interventions may be tested simultaneously in children and adults by enrolling children as a prespecified subgroup within a larger adult randomized clinical trial or by enrolling children in a separate trial conducted in parallel. both approaches raise practical and analytical challenges that can frequently be met. for example, investigators might choose outcome measures that are appropriate for both adults and children. additionally, using bayesian approaches to link the estimates of treatment effects in children to the values observed in adults may enhance the statistical power to detect pediatric specific effects. finally, centralized institutional review boards and data monitoring centers may alleviate practical concerns with conducting trials among adults and children simultaneously. conclusions the current standard of testing critical care interventions in adults before children rests on tenuous ethical arguments and is entrenched by the methodologic and logistic barriers encountered with alternative approaches. however, these barriers will frequently be surmountable. we therefore propose that the default paradigm be changed such that interventions are examined routinely in critically ill children and adults simultaneously unless unique reasons exist to the contrary.",0.4777183600713013,0.16815742397137745,0.2922649538419217
"Although it is well documented that exposure to stressful life experiences increases risk for adverse physical and mental health outcomes , this stress related increase in risk is not uniform.

Almost nothing is known about how PPi is transported across acidocalcisomes or why it is stored.Acidocalcisomes were found in bacteria more than one hundred years ago but an investigation of these organelles, and of their main constituent, poly P, has been neglected for many years. The conservation of this organelle in bacteria and eukaryotes indicates that it has important functions that await discovery.

"While the major source of nitric oxide (NO) in mammals are the nitric oxide synthases (NOS), recent studies have shown alternate sources also exist. Specifically, dietary nitrate can be reduced to nitrite, which in turn is reduced to NO and other nitrosating species at low oxygen tensions and low pH ensuring NO homeostasis in hypoxic tissues (, ). Endogenously formed nitrate or dietary nitrate, is first concentrated into the saliva reaching millimolar concentrations.Scrapings from the posterior tongue were collected from male and female adults using the narrow end of a sterile disposable lab spatula.

"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease and is widely thought to primarily affect the dopamine (DA) neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). PD is considered to be due to the combination of genetic and environmental factors [ ].

When the neurons in the SNpc die, the levels of dopamine in the striatum decrease resulting in a loss of voluntary motor control. The cardinal symptoms of PD include tremor, rigidity, postural instability, and bradykinesia, which have contributed to the basis of most behavioral testing in mouse models of PD.In addition to motor deficits, there are a variety of non motor symptoms associated with PD. These symptoms may precede the onset of motor symptoms, sometimes by years, and include anosmia, problems with gastrointestinal motility, sleep disturbances, cognitive deficits, anxiety, and depression. As research in the field advances, non motor symptoms associated with Parkinsonism have been illuminated, demonstrating that PD is not exclusive to dopaminergic disturbances; norepinephrine (NE), serotonin (5 HT), and non aminergic transmitter systems may significantly contribute to disease progression as well.",PMC2862121.json,"parkinson's disease (pd) is a common neurodegenerative movement disorder afflicting millions of people in the united states. the advent of transgenic technologies has contributed to the development of several new mouse models, many of which recapitulate some aspects of the disease; however, no model has been demonstrated to faithfully reproduce the full constellation of symptoms seen in human pd. this may be due in part to the narrow focus on the dopamine mediated motor deficits. as current research continues to unmask pd as a multi system disorder, animal models should similarly evolve to include the non motor features of the disease. this requires that typically cited behavioral test batteries be expanded. the major non motor symptoms observed in pd patients include hyposmia, sleep disturbances, gastrointestinal dysfunction, autonomic dysfunction, anxiety, depression, and cognitive decline. mouse behavioral tests exist for all of these symptoms and while some models have begun to be reassessed for the prevalence of this broader behavioral phenotype, the majority has not. moreover, all behavioral paradigms should be tested for their responsiveness to l dopa so these data can be compared to patient response and help elucidate which symptoms are likely not dopamine mediated. here, we suggest an extensive, yet feasible, battery of behavioral tests for mouse models of pd aimed to better assess both non motor and motor deficits associated with the disease.",0.4848484848484849,0.12608695652173912,0.27468453880413124
"Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) promotes the transfer of cholesteryl esters from high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) to other lipoprotein particles, and individuals genetically deficient for CETP often have extremely high HDLC levels, . In part on this basis, and because of consistent epidemiologic evidence that elevated levels of HDLC are protective against cardiovascular disease, inhibitors of CETP were developed with the hope that raising HDLC through this mechanism would reduce vascular event rates. However, in the recently reported ILLUMINATE trial of torcetrapib conducted among more than 15,000 individuals at high risk for cardiovascular disease, mortality rates were increased in the active as compared to placebo treatment group leading to considerable debate as to whether CETP and/or HDLC are in fact causal for heart disease and should remain viable pharmacologic targets,  .We evaluated the role of polymorphisms that impact upon HDLC as potential determinants of incident myocardial infarction among participants in the prospective Womens Genome Health Study (WGHS). In brief, participants in the WGHS include initially healthy American women aged 45 and older with no prior history of cardiovascular disease, cancer, or other major chronic illness who provided a baseline blood sample during the enrollment phase of the Womens Health Study between 1992 and 1995, and who gave consent for blood based analyses related to risks of incident chronic diseases .

Instead, the conventional method used to estimate the organ absorbed dose is based on the MIRD methodology.For each phantom and at each time point, we applied three different organ activity quantification methods: the conventional planar (CPlanar), the quantitative planar (QPlanar), and the quantitative SPECT processing methods (QSPECT). In the QPlanar method, the true 3D organ VOIs from the phantom configurations were used to overcome the overlap problem in the CPlanar method. Uniform activity distributions inside each organ were assumed.In this work, we have developed a phantom population based on anatomical, biodistribution, and biokinetics data obtained from seven patient studies.

"Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is a developmental condition characterized by a loss of the drive to breathe during sleep, reduced ventilatory sensitivity to CO2 and O2, and multiple thermoregulatory, affective, and autonomic deficiencies (). The affective and thermoregulatory functions depend on more rostral brain sites, such as the hypothalamus and limbic regions, and these areas show injury with quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques, such as T2 relaxometry and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) based mean diffusivity measures (, ) . Although several physiological and emotional deficits in CCHS result from rostral brain injury, other breathing and autonomic problems, such as diminished ventilatory sensitivity to CO2 and parasympathetic deficits implicate brainstem involvement.Regions of interest were created for clusters showing increased axial diffusivity only, radial diffusivity alone, and both increased axial and radial diffusivity in brainstem and cerebellar regions, based on voxel based analyses procedures for all distinct locations. Using these region of interest masks, mean axial and radial diffusivity values were derived from each individual's normalized and smoothed axial and radial diffusivity maps, and significant group differences for these distinct brain locations were evaluated using multivariate analysis of covariance (SPSS, v15, Chicago, IL), with age and gender included as covariates .

"Oxygenation in the lung depends on both ventilation and perfusion distributions that become abnormal in the setting of acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) is a fundamental homeostatic mechanism by which the lung preserves oxygenation during injury. HPV causes pulmonary arterial vessels to constrict in response to local hypoxia, redistributing blood flow away from poorly ventilated regions and toward lung regions that are well ventilated, optimizing local ventilation/perfusion matching and minimizing shunt fraction (Qs/Qt).After induction of anesthesia and instrumentation, Lactated Ringers solution was bolused (20 ml/kg i.v. over 30 minutes) and followed by a maintenance infusion of 6 ml/kg/hour for the remainder of the experiment.

"The pace of chronic pain research seems to have quickened over the last several decades, which includes the present Decade of Pain Control and Research, perhaps as a consequence of increasing awareness regarding the enormous public health costs and challenges associated with chronic pain conditions. As numerous reviews have noted, the symptom of pain accounts for over 80% of all physician visits; chronic pain affects over 50 million Americans annually, and the annual costs of chronic pain likely exceed $100 billion in health care expenses and lost productivity. The biopsychosocial model of pain has now almost universally replaced the traditional biomedical characterizations of pain that focused on disease and injury related activation of specific receptors in the peripheral nervous system that directly transmitted pain related information to the brain.Mindbody interactions in pain: the neurophysiology of anxious and catastrophic pain related thoughts 19218091 Some other studies have provided evidence that catastrophizing may exert a broad influence on physiologic responses to pain, and that its influence may extend across multiple systems. For example, in several studies of healthy young adults, catastrophizing predicted increased systolic blood pressure reactivity to pain and enhanced myocardial contractility for a prolonged period of time following a cold pressor task. Relatedly, catastrophizing seems to influence the relationship among muscle tension, cardiovascular stress, and pain response; electromyography suggests that under specific conditions, catastrophizing is positively related to indices of lumbar paraspinal muscle responses.Taken together, this literature provides demonstrative evidence for complex neuroendocrine, neuroimmune, psychophysiologic, and functional neuroanatomic effects of catastrophizing on the pain experience. Research that examines both physiological and psychosocial factors and how they shape long term pain outcomes is an exciting area for future study and highlights the truly biopsychosocial nature of the pain experience. Future studies may wish to examine: (1) some potential molecular bases for the identified neurophysiologic underpinnings of catastrophizing, (2) whether reorganization of integrated physiological systems takes place following prolonged catastrophic thinking, (3) whether catastrophizing reducing interventions alter pain related neurophysiology, and (4) how factors such as individual differences in genotype or in central nervous system pain processing might moderate the effects of catastrophizing on long term pain outcomes.",PMC2738609.json,"the well accepted biopsychosocial model proposes that the experience of pain and responses to it result from a complex interaction of biological, psychological, and social factors. however, the separation of these constructs is substantially artificial, and we presume that psychological processes have biological effects, that biological processes affect an individuals psychosocial environment, and so on. considerable research has demonstrated that pain coping strategies influence perceived pain intensity and physical functioning, and individual differences in styles of pain coping even shape the persistence of long term pain complaints in some populations. a good deal of this coping research has focused on catastrophizing, which is a generally maladaptive cognitive and emotional mental set that involves feelings of helplessness when in pain, rumination about pain symptoms, and magnification of pain related complaints. collectively, catastrophizing has been consistently associated with heightened experiences of pain across a variety of samples. although catastrophic thinking regarding pain related symptoms is often classified under the psychologic category within the broader biopsychosocial model, we propose that catastrophizing exerts biologic effects that may account for some of its negative consequences. in general, the cognitive and affective processes captured within the construct of catastrophizing may exert effects on the neuromuscular, cardiovascular, immune, and neuroendocrine systems, and on the activity in the pain neuromatrix within the brain. the interface between pain related neurobiology and processes such as pain related catastrophizing represents an important avenue for future pain research.",0.468013468013468,0.10135135135135136,0.2608346567635496
"T cells use T cell receptors (TCRs) to probe short peptides presented by major histocompatibility complexes (pMHCs) on the surface of antigen presenting cells (APCs). A specific pMHC TCR binding leads to an intracellular signaling cascade that ultimately activates T cells. pMHC TCR interaction is therefore the molecular basis for immune recognition.T cell receptor triggering by force The most compelling evidence for concealed ITAMs in unstimulated T cells comes from a recent report that looked into the interaction between CD3 and lipids . Mutation and imaging experiments demonstrated that the CD3 cytoplasmic domain binds to the plasma membrane through charge interactions. Circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy revealed that lipid binding induces partial folding of CD3.We propose that TCR triggering is intimately coupled with the motor system of T cells, which generates mechanical forces not only to help T cells find specific pMHCs through cell motility, but also to initiate TCR signaling through receptor deformation. The receptor deformation model of TCR triggering is consistent with the indispensable role of actin and myosin in TCR signaling [, ].

Previous studies have identified several ways in which Bmi 1 mediates its effects on cell proliferation, including inhibiting expression of the Ink4A/ARF locus , modulating the p21 Rb pathway , and inducing telomerase activity  .Identification of a polymorphism in the RING finger of human Bmi 1 that causes its degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome system 19233177 HEK293T cells were transfected with pEGFP Bmi 1 or pEGFP C18Y Bmi 1 as described above. At 48 hours post transfection, cells were extracted on ice with NP 40 lysis buffer (1% NP 40, 50 mM Tris HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied Science) and 20 mM N ethylmaleimide (added fresh)) for 20 min. Lysates were then cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4C.As depicted in , the Bmi 1 protein contains a RING finger domain in its N terminal region [,,]. Examination of the dbSNP database revealed the existence of a polymorphism in human Bmi 1 that changes amino acid 18, a cysteine in the RING finger domain, to tyrosine . Further analysis revealed that individuals that are heterozygous for this polymorphism are found in both the CEU (Utah residents with ancestry from northern and western Europe) and YRI (Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria) populations that were studied as part of the International HapMap Project [] .",PMC2657319.json,"bmi 1 is a polycomb protein that plays an important role in tumor cell development and maintaining stem cell populations of many cell lineages. here we identify a polymorphism in human bmi 1 that changes a cysteine within its ring domain to tyrosine. this c18y polymorphism is associated with a significant decrease in bmi 1 level and its elevated ubiquitination, suggesting that it is being destroyed by the ubiquitin proteasome system. consistent with this, treating cells with the proteasome inhibitor mg 132 significantly increases c18y bmi 1 levels. this is the first example of a polymorphism in bmi 1 that reduces levels of this important protein.",0.34120734908136485,0.13720316622691292,0.27053493465215783
"Previously considered intracellular depots where cells store neutral lipids, mostly triglycerides (TG) and cholesteryl esters (CE) to be used in times of need, we currently understand lipid droplets (LDs) as dynamic functional organelles. LDs play crucial roles in cellular energy balance and in the regulation of other important cellular processes []. The structure of LDs resembles that of plasma lipoproteins, with a core of lipid esters (neutral lipid) coated and stabilized in the cytoplasm by an interface composed of a monolayer of phospholipids, free cholesterol (FC), and proteins.The PAT Family of Lipid Droplet Proteins in Heart and Vascular Cells 18959832 The heart is an organ of high energy turnover that can oxidize both fat and carbohydrates. In the fasted state, the energy needs of the cardiomyocyte are predominantly met by  oxidation of long chain fatty acids . Although the heart needs to burn large amounts of fuel to provide energy for contraction, the healthy heart has a relatively low TG reserve, which is stored in multiple minute LDs distributed throughout the sarcoplasm.Despite the relevance of intracellular lipid storage and mobilization to atherosclerosis and cardiomyopathy, studies of the major coat proteins of cytoplasmic LDs, the PAT proteins, in the heart and vascular cells are in the early stages. Most attention in the PAT protein field has centered on triglyceride containing LDs in adipocytes and the liver. The next decade of PAT protein research will no doubt build on the provocative data that have emerged in the cardiovascular system as reviewed here.",PMC2892414.json,"cytoplasmic lipid droplets (lds) are organelles in which cells store neutral lipids for use as an energy source in times of need, but they also play important roles in the regulation of key metabolic processes. although lds are essential for normal cell function, excess accumulation of intracellular lipid is associated with several metabolic diseases, including obesity, type diabetes, and atherosclerosis. the function of lds is regulated by their associated proteins, including the members of the pat family: perilipin, adipophilin/adipose differentiationrelated protein, tail interacting protein 47, s3 12, and oxpat/myocardial ld protein/lipid storage droplet protein 5. in this review we discuss the pat proteins in two cardiovascular contexts: 1) in the atherosclerotic vessel wall, where lds within macrophage foam cells store cholesteryl esters derived from modified lipoproteins, and 2) in the myocardium, where lds store fatty acids, the major energy substrate for normal heart function, as triglyceride.",0.44110275689223055,0.1410579345088161,0.26873933667660027
"Approximately 37 million people worldwide suffer from blindness, with up to 20% or 7.4 million having vision of only light perception or less. Much of this irreversible blindness is due to age related diseases such as macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma, as well as trauma and ocular tumours.  The irreversible nature of these diseases is a result of permanent optic nerve damage.19286686 Pertinent articles were identified through a multistage systematic approach. In the first stage, a computerised search of MEDLINE database (National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, Maryland) was performed. The search terms optic nerve regeneration, eye transplantation, isolated perfused eye, retinal ganglion cell survival axotomy and circulatory revascularisation of the eye from the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH0 supplement to Index Medicus (National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, Maryland) were used for a broad search.Whole eye transplantation may prove to be the ultimate treatment for irreversible causes of blindness.

(3) following optic nerve transection, is there a correlation between retinal ganglion cell (rgc) survival and either time after transection or proximity of the transection to the globe? in a majority of the studies performed in the literature, recovery of visual function can occur after whole eye transplantation in cold blooded vertebrates. following enucleation (and reperfusion), outer retinal function is maintained from to h. rgc survival following optic nerve transection is inversely related to both the time since transection and the proximity of transection to the globe. lastly, neurotrophins can increase rgc survival following optic nerve transection. this review of the literature suggests that the use of a donor eye is feasible for whole eye transplantation.",0.3857868020304568,0.07653061224489797,0.2369566814356457
"Kidney disease in HIV infected individuals was initially described more than two decades ago. Advances in HIV care, most notably the introduction of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) at the end of 1995, have resulted in decreased progression to AIDS and mortality, as well as a reduced incidence of opportunistic infections. Subsequently, non AIDS complications such as kidney, liver, and cardiovascular disease have emerged as important problems in ART treated patients.Several studies have described the incidence and causes of AKI in patients with HIV over the past two decades; however, direct comparisons before and after the advent of ART are difficult due to the lack of consistent inclusion criteria or definitions of AKI. Consensus guidelines for the management of kidney disease in patients with HIV recommend a definition of acute renal failure based on an increase in serum creatinine >1.5 mg/dL, or >1.3 times the upper limit of normal at the respective clinical laboratory, that returns to baseline values within three months. A recent interdisciplinary consensus panel has classified AKI in the general population according to a change from baseline serum creatinine or a decrease in urine output, but this classification system has not been widely adopted.AKI remains common in HIV infected patients, despite improvements in morbidity and mortality in the ART era. Beyond identifying patients at risk for AKI, successful prevention depends on optimizing immune status, as well as identifying and aggressively treating diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and hepatitis co infection. The importance of prevention or early recognition of AKI is highlighted by the strong association between AKI and mortality among HIV infected patients.",PMC2676161.json,"acute kidney injury is common in hiv infected patients, and has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality. prior to the introduction of effective antiretroviral therapy, acute kidney injury in hiv positive patients was most commonly the result of volume depletion, septicemia, or nephrotoxic medications. acute kidney injury remains a significant problem in the antiretroviral era, and is still commonly attributed to infection or nephrotoxic medications. less common causes such as direct infectious insults, immune restoration inflammatory syndrome, rhabdomyolysis, and obstruction should be considered when the underlying process is not obvious. in addition to advanced hiv disease, several other patient characteristics have emerged as potential risk factors for acute kidney injury in the antiretroviral era, including older age, diabetes, pre existing chronic kidney disease, and hepatitis co infection or liver disease.",0.39,0.12562814070351758,0.2527329289884666

"The publication of the draft sequence of the common chimpanzee genome in September 2005 was heralded as an advance that confirmed what Darwin and Huxley posited more than a century ago: humans share common ancestors with African great apes,. In addition to highlighting vast homologies between human and chimpanzee DNA, primate comparative genomics is also providing insights into the question of what makes members of Homo sapiens different from their nearest evolutionary relatives.. There is great interest in identifying the genetic factors that underlie the traits that are traditionally taken to be the hallmarks of our species: higher cognition, complex language and vocalizations systems, skin phenotypes, immune and reproduction system function,, sensory perception,, degree of self and social awareness, and other idiosyncrasies of our physiology, anatomy and behavior .The Ethics of Using Transgenic Non Human Primates to Study What Makes Us Human 20717156  The transfer of an HLS gene or genomic variant into an NHP could have a specific, discreet effect that has a more or less dramatic impact on a phenotype of relevance to human function. However, biomolecular systems are interdependent, and most genes appear to have multiple functions that can be seemingly unrelated. So, such a transfer could just as easily have a wide array of unexpected and/or deleterious effects.A few conclusions can be drawn from this discussion. First, because of the close evolutionary genomic proximity, transgenic apes have the greatest potential to express HLS sequences as they are expressed in Homo sapiens and consequently experience harm from transgenic research. This is in part due to the fact that humanized transgenic apes would likely exhibit traits that are the most human like, putting them at greater risk of exploitation.",PMC2995325.json,"an ongoing flood of comparative genomic data is identifying human lineage specific (hls) sequences of unknown function, and there is strong interest in investigating their functional effects. transgenic apes, our closest evolutionary relative, have the highest potential to express hls sequences as they are expressed in homo sapiens and likewise experience harm from such transgenic research. these harms render the conduct of this research ethically unacceptable in apes, justifying regulatory barriers between these species and all other non human primates for transgenic research.",0.32786885245901637,0.13186813186813184,0.27598272516049566

We use key pharmacogenomic entities (genes, drugs, phenotypes) to bootstrap a process whereby other entities that are modified by these concepts are identified and stored in an ontology. The relationships used in pharmacogenomics literature are also captured and normalized, yielding a core set of 41,134 relationships that capture approximately 80% of extracted relationships in the text.",PMC2991587.json,"most pharmacogenomics knowledge is contained in the text of published studies, and is thus not available for automated computation. natural language processing (nlp) techniques for extracting relationships in specific domains often rely on hand built rules and domain specific ontologies to achieve good performance. in a new and evolving field such as pharmacogenomics (pgx), rules and ontologies may not be available. recent progress in syntactic nlp parsing in the context of a large corpus of pharmacogenomics text provides new opportunities for automated relationship extraction. we describe an ontology of pgx relationships built starting from a lexicon of key pharmacogenomic entities and a syntactic parse of more than million sentences from million medline abstracts. we used the syntactic structure of pgx statements to systematically extract commonly occurring relationships and to map them to a common schema. our extracted relationships have a to 87.7% precision and involve not only key pgx entities such as genes, drugs, and phenotypes (e.g., vkorc1, warfarin, clotting disorder), but also critical entities that are frequently modified by these key entities (e.g., vkorc1 polymorphism, warfarin response, clotting disorder treatment). the result of our analysis is a network of 40,000 relationships between more than entity types with clear semantics. this network is used to guide the curation of pgx knowledge and provide a computable resource for knowledge discovery.",0.4619289340101523,0.12755102040816327,0.3033103922088537
"Near infrared (NIR) spectral tomography is a noninvasive method to obtain physiological information about tissue and has been used in imaging applications associated with breast cancer and brain function. The accuracy in estimating absorber concentrations is superior when time resolved or frequency domain measurements are used because these data types provide a measure of the average photon path length, which allows diffusion theory to be used to separate absorption from scattering values []. However, the ill posed nature of NIR image reconstruction can limit the accuracy of the spectral fitting process, thereby producing substantial errors in the concentration values of absorbers.Broadband frequency domain near infrared spectral tomography using a mode locked Ti:sapphire laser 19340109 The broadband frequency domain system provided a unique approach to test presented noise models because the measurement wavelengths could be chosen freely across the Ti:sapphire laser tuning range. To study the resulting image accuracy of this system, gelatin phantom experiments with a heterogeneous target were constructed for hemoglobin concentration measurements. The gelatin phantom was composed of porcine gelatin (Sigma Aldrich G2500), TiO2 powder (Sigma Aldrich T8141), porcine blood, and saline.In summary, a new frequency domain system consisting of a tunable pulsed laser was developed for NIR spectroscopic imaging. The intrinsic signal from the laser was used for lock in detection. This system exhibited excellent stability across the entire wavelength range of operation and resulted in noise levels that are essentially equivalent to using a diode laser source.",PMC2804890.json,"frequency domain near infrared (nir) diffuse spectral tomography with a mode locked ti:sapphire laser is presented, providing tunable multiwavelength quantitative spectroscopy with maximal power for thick tissue imaging. the system was developed to show that intrinsically high stability can be achieved with many wavelengths in the nir range, using a mode locked signal of mhz with heterodyned lock in detection. the effect of cumulative noise from multiple wavelengths of data on the reconstruction process was studied, and it was shown that inclusion of more wavelengths can reduce skew in the noise distribution. this normalization of the data variance then minimizes errors in estimation of chromophore concentrations. simulations and tissue phantom experiments were used to quantify this improvement in image accuracy for recovery of tissue hemoglobin and oxygen saturation.",0.450402144772118,0.13477088948787064,0.231737303400365
"PACAP was first isolated from ovine hypothalamic extracts based on its ability to stimulate cAMP production in anterior pituitary cells. It is a highly conserved member of the VIP/secretin/glucagon peptide family with pleiotropic functions in development, cell signaling, metabolism, homeostasis and cell protection. Among these myriad functions are studies demonstratingThis highly traumatized, civilian, cross sectional cohort has been previously described in candidate gene association studies of PTSD and depression. Research interviews, salivary DNA and blood samples were collected from patients receiving services in the primary care clinics at Grady Memorial Hospital (Atlanta, GA). All study procedures have been reviewed and approved by the Emory Institutional Review Board and the Grady Hospital Research Oversight Committee.Since its identification more than 20 years ago, PACAP has been increasingly implicated in diverse cellular stress response pathways and neurotrophic function.

"The increasing world population has generated the need to raise yields of primary production, resulting in turn in an increased use of conventional pesticides to control pest damages in crops. The use of classical pesticides yields effective results in the short term, but it has different drawbacks, such as the development of resistance and the adverse environmental effects on the biotic and abiotic environment. The latest trend in agricultural production calls therefore for the implementation of alternatives to the use of conventional pesticides.The aerial parts (fruits, leaf and twigs) of the plants under investigation were collected in the fall of 2005, at two riverbanks nearby Montevideo city.

"Do you have a lengthy commute to work? If so, you may sympathize with the many organelles in your neurons that require several days to travel to their synaptic place of work. Neurons evolved long axons to maximize circuitry, not to minimize transportation costs from the cell soma to the terminals.Two recent examples of how transport of vesicular cargos is modulated by adaptor complexes are illustrated above. (A) Recent work in the fly indicates that the interaction between the KHC/KLC kinesin complex and the JNK adaptor, JIP1 (APLIP1 in the fly) is modulated by the JNK signaling pathway . Synaptic material accumulates in axons when APLIP1 is overexpressed.Diverse cargos are needed at the synapse, but despite their common destiny they have distinct regulatory needs that are reflected in a diversity of kinesins, adaptors, and regulator proteins. The extreme length of neuronal processes makes them vulnerable to transport defects.

In the present study, each SCID was reviewed by the principal investigator (PI) to ensure interrater agreement on inclusion/exclusion criteria. No disagreements between the SCID interviewer and the PI regarding inclusion/exclusion were observed .A manipulation check was first conducted to ensure that the CO2 challenge elicited clinically meaningful physiological arousal. Specifically, paired samples t tests were conducted between baseline (i.e., last minute of baseline) and challenge (i.e., last minute of CO2 challenge) heart rate (HR) and respiration rates. A paired samples t test showed that challenge HR levels (M = 90.72, SD = 14.19) were significantly greater than baseline HR levels (M = 81.01, SD = 10.32; t = 10.30, p < .001).",PMC2794975.json,"the current study investigated anxiety sensitivity, distress tolerance (simons & gaher, 2005), and discomfort intolerance (schmidt, richey, cromer, & buckner, 2007) in relation to panic relevant responding (i.e., panic attack symptoms and panic relevant cognitions) to a 10% carbon dioxide enriched air challenge. participants were adults (52.6% female; m age = 22.4, sd = 9.0). a series of hierarchical multiple regressions was conducted with covariates of negative affectivity and past year panic attack history in step one of the model, and anxiety sensitivity, discomfort intolerance, and distress tolerance entered simultaneously into step two. results indicated that anxiety sensitivity, but not distress tolerance or discomfort intolerance, was significantly incrementally predictive of physical panic attack symptoms and cognitive panic attack symptoms. additionally, anxiety sensitivity was significantly predictive of variance in panic attack status during the challenge. these findings emphasize the important, unique role of anxiety sensitivity in predicting risk for panic psychopathology, even when considered in the context of other theoretically relevant emotion vulnerability variables.",0.3106796116504854,0.058536585365853655,0.1787517030333801
"Our environment consists of events that are often predictable. Predictability can be absolute (e.g., when mommy puts a bottle in my mouth, I will always get food) or it can be probabilistic (e.g., after feeding, mommy usually puts me down for a nap). Abstraction of the underlying structure of an event requires keeping track of adjacent sequential relations based on the redundancy found in the environment.We used an infant controlled habituation/test procedure (i.e., the length of each trial, regardless of whether it was a habituation or a test trial, was controlled by the infants looking at the stimulus display monitor). Whenever the infant looked at the monitor, the appropriate movie (i.e., trial) began and as soon as the infant either looked away from the monitor for more than two seconds or accumulated a total of 60 seconds of looking, the trial ended. To attract the infants attention back to the monitor following a look away, we presented a beeping sound through a set of speakers positioned on each side of the monitor.Previous statistical learning studies with infants between 2 and 8 months of age (; ; ; ) have found that infants can recognize violations in the conditional probability linking the members of a pair of sequentially presented elements. Importantly, however, these studies did not investigate the role of pair frequency, either because pair frequency information was confounded with conditional probability information, or pair frequency information was controlled.

Mice were injected with 50 l of indicated antigen intramuscularly (into right hind legs tibialis anterior muscle) using insulin syringes (3/10 ml/cc) with the BD Ultra Fine needle (30G). Injection 1, 2, and 3 were performed at biweekly intervals starting at 3 mo. of age .The amyloid cascade hypothesis considers pathological A as a triggering toxic event in AD and most clinical immunotherapy approaches have been aimed at reducing A deposits. However, accumulating evidence show that pathological tau correlates with the onset of symptoms and the degree of dementia better than A deposition. It is important to note that the lessons from clinical trials of active and passive immunization targeting A suggest that anti A immunotherapy may be effective in the early/preclinical stages of AD, whereas in the later stages, clearing of A alone may not be sufficient to stop/delay the disease.",PMC6980698.json,"abnormal tau hyperphosphorylation and its aggregation into neurofibrillary tangles are a hallmark of tauopathies, neurodegenerative disorders that include alzheimers disease (ad). active and passive tau immunotherapy has been proposed as a therapeutic approach to ad with mixed results. one of the limitations of active immunotherapy may be associated with the mediocre immunogenicity of vaccines that are not inducing therapeutically potent titers of antibodies. the aim of this study was to test the efficacy of an anti tau vaccine, av 1980r/a composed of n terminal peptide of this molecule fused with an immunogenic multitep platform and formulated in a strong adjuvant, advaxcpg in a tg4510 mouse model of tauopathy. experimental mice were immunized with av 1980r/a and a control group of mice were injected with adjuvant only. nontransgenic and tetracycline transactivator (tta) transgenic littermates were included as baseline controls to contrast with the tau phenotype. active immunization with av 1980r/a induced very strong anti tau humoral immune responses in both nontransgenic and transgenic mice with evidence of igg in brains of av 1980r/a vaccinated mice. these experimental animals displayed an improvement in short term memory during a novel object recognition test. however, impairments in other behavioral tasks were not prevented by av 1980r/a vaccinations. at the same time, high titers of anti tau antibodies reduced hyperphosphorylated pser396 tau but did not lower the level of other phosphorylated tau species in the brains of av 1980r/a vaccinated mice. these data indicate that active immunotherapy with an n terminal tau epitope was only partially effective in improving cognition and reducing pathology in the stringent tg4510 mouse model of tauopathy.",0.448087431693989,0.10968921389396709,0.26589320168216163

"Central dopamine (DA) systems attract intense interest because they participate in multiple aspects of normal brain function and because DA dysfunctions are implicated in multiple CNS disorders, including Parkinson's disease (; ; ), schizophrenia , attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , and substance abuse . Current theories on the multiple functions of DA invoke the concept that extracellular DA operates on multiple timescales. In a recent review, Schultz pointed out that DA functions can be divided approximately between those involving rapid changes in extracellular DA concentrations (sub seconds to seconds) and slow changes (minutes to tens of minutes) .Carbon fiber microelectrodes were constructed by inserting a single carbon fiber (7 m diameter, Thornell Carbon Fiber, T300, Amoco Performance Products, Inc., Greenville, SC) into a borosilicate glass capillary (0.75 mm I.D., 1 mm O.D., Sutter Instruments, Co., Novato, CA).

"Non invasive neuroimaging techniques have lead to significant advances in our current understanding of the neurobiology and treatment of drug addiction in humans. Nuclear imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) has defined the pharmacokinetics of abused stimulants in vivo in the human brain and related these findings to the time course of behavioral effects associated with their addictive properties. With support from work that has provided new radiotracers and enhanced the resolution of imaging systems, nuclear medicine techniques have also been employed to characterize drug interactions in vivo with specific protein targets in brain, including neurotransmitter receptors and transporters.Nonhuman Primate Neuroimaging and the Neurobiology of Psychostimulant Addiction 18991958 It has become well accepted that behavior, brain chemistry and neuronal function can be readily influenced by environmental conditions as well as by pharmacological challenges. Neuroimaging techniques are especially useful for studying the dynamic changes in neuronal function that may be associated with environmental variables. For example, differences in housing conditions and the dominance rank among socially housed nonhuman primates have been associated with differential levels of dopamine D2 receptors.Recent advances in nonhuman primate neuroimaging have documented drug induced functional changes in brain activity under physiologically relevant conditions. Neuroimaging of cerebral blood flow changes coupled to cerebral metabolism measured with PET and fMRI is particularly well suited to define the neuronal circuitry that underlies drug effects on behavior. The ability to study drug interactions with specific protein targets in vivo has supported medications development efforts that have focused primarily on behavioral models of drug abuse.",PMC2585996.json,"neuroimaging techniques have lead to significant advances in our understanding of the neurobiology and treatment of drug addiction in humans. the capability to conduct parallel studies in nonhuman primates and human subjects provides a powerful translational approach to link findings in human and animal research. a significant advantage of nonhuman primate models is the ability to use drug nave subjects in longitudinal designs that document the neurobiological changes that are associated with chronic drug use. moreover, experimental therapeutics can be evaluated in subjects with well documented histories of drug exposure. the in vivo distribution and pharmacokinetics of drug binding in brain have been related to the time course of behavioral effects associated with the addictive properties of stimulants. importantly, the characterization of drug interactions with specific protein targets in brain has identified potential targets for medications development. neuroimaging has proven especially useful in studying the dynamic changes in neuronal function that may be associated with environmental variables. lastly, neuroimaging has been used effectively in nonhuman primates to characterize both transient and long lasting changes in brain chemistry associated with chronic drug exposure. although there is some evidence to suggest neurotoxicity in humans with long histories of stimulant use, parallel studies in nonhuman primates have not identified consistent long term changes in such neurochemical markers. collectively, the results of these studies of nonhuman primates have enhanced our understanding of the neurobiological basis of stimulant addiction and should have a significant impact on efforts to develop medications to treat stimulant abuse.",0.5714285714285714,0.2632612966601178,0.3996773527934324
"Many publicly available data sets, performance metrics, methods, and associated software under the name Segmentation Challenges exist for evaluating medical image segmentation algorithms. However, it is currently not possible to obtain a quantitative understanding of segmentation performance as a function of input image quality. Consequently, it is impossible to present a holistic picture of segmentation performance independent of input image specific vagaries due to unknown quality.We retrospectively created a database of a mix of contrast enhanced and un enhanced CT images and dosimetrist drawn contours in 216 cancer studies in head and neck (H&N) from the Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Pennsylvania on this IRB approved study.

These advantages are likely to benefit high resolution applications, for example mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis , and quantitative imaging of trabecular bone. The capability for in vivo evaluation of trabecular detail could significantly enhance clinical applications of the recently introduced extremities CBCT systems ,.Imaging studies were performed on a CMOS CBCT test bench in the geometry of the extremity CBCT system (SAD=380 mm, SDD=530 mm). A 0.3 FS compact rotating anode x ray source with 3 kW maximal power (IMD RTM 37, IMD, IT) was used. As mentioned in Sec. 2.1, two DALSA Xineos 3030HR CMOS detectors with different nominal scintillator thicknesses (700 m and 400 m) were both evaluated on the bench.The theoretical and experimental studies confirm the benefits of using a scintillator thinner than the current industrial standard in CMOS detectors developed for high resolutions tasks in orthopedic imaging. The fact that better performance was achieved with the 400 m scintillator despite the comparable high frequency DQE of the sensors with 400 m and 700 m CsI suggests that the improved MTF of the 400 m CsI plays a stronger role in determining the performance in the high frequency tasks than the increased noise.

With regard to the first issue, comprehensive genetic counseling and testing seems to improve patients' understanding of genetics, but they still might not fully understand the meaning of genetic test results for their disease risk.",PMC2852315.json,"advances in the genetic basis of kidney disease may mean that genetic testing is increasingly important in reducing disease morbidity and mortality among patients. however, there is little research examining patient responses to genetic information for mendelian and common kidney diseases. existing research on kidney and other hereditary cancer syndromes can inform three major issues relevant to the nephrology context: (1) how patients understand their risk of disease following genetic counseling and testing; (2) their emotional responses to the information; and (3) their uptake of recommended risk reducing strategies. prior research suggests that genetic counseling and testing may improve patient understanding of genetics, but patients still might not fully understand the meaning of their results for disease risk. genetic counseling and testing does not appear to result in long term negative emotional effects among patients who carry mutations or those who do not. finally, while genetic counseling and testing may improve adherence to recommended screening strategies, adherence varies substantially across different risk reduction options. previous research also suggests that computer based interventions might be a useful adjunct to genetic counseling approaches. examining whether and how these prior findings relate to the context of hereditary kidney disease is an important area for future research.",0.272552783109405,0.1076923076923077,0.18163937117356568
"The adult CNS displays a large repertoire of adaptive behaviors acquired through practice, usually referred to as skills. These skills are normally produced by muscles. In contrast, brain computer interfaces (BCIs) enable people to communicate or to control devices by using brain signals rather than muscles.10.1088/1741 2560/7/3/036007     The factors that determine the control possible with EEG, ECoG, and intracortical BCI methods are as yet unknown. Many efforts to develop BCI multidimensional movement control have started from the assumption that high resolution signals are essential, and thus they have used intracortical electrodes to record neuronal action potentials or local field potentials (; ; , ; ; ; ). Intracortical methods provide the highest resolution signals.shows, for each users final training sessions, the set of EEG features (specific frequency bands from specific scalp electrodes) that comprised the independent variable for each of the three linear equations that controlled the three movement dimensions.

"From the outset of the HIV epidemic, substance use disorders, including the injection of drugs, has fueled HIV transmission and disease progression . Despite people who use drugs (PWUD) contributing less to HIV incidence in the U.S. recently , they remain a priority population for HIV prevention because of potential HIV transmission associated with preventable drug related (e.g., needle sharing) and sex related (e.g., condomless sex) risk behaviors (; ; ; ). PWUD are affected by multi level barriers to treatment and prevention such as stigma, discrimination, and social marginalization, thus posing a formidable challenge to access HIV services .Participants were recruited at the APT Foundation, which provides methadone maintenance treatment to over 7,000 patients in the greater New Haven, Connecticut community. Convenience sampling was used to recruit participants through flyers, peers, word of mouth, and direct referral from counselors. Screening was conducted by trained research assistants in a private room at APT Foundation or by phone.PWUD in MMPs are a high risk population who would benefit from both biomedical (PrEP) and behavioral intervention strategies to prevent HIV.

"Echocardiographic measurements of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, LV dilatation, and left atrial (LA) dilatation are predictive of adverse events. Specifically, LV wall thickness, LV mass,, LA diameter,, LA volume, and LVend systolic volume (ESV) are predictive of heart failure (HF) hospitalization and mortality. Indexing measurements to body size may provide additional useful and prognostic information, because larger individuals normally have larger heart size.Predicting Heart Failure Hospitalization and Mortality by Quantitative Echocardiography: Is Body Surface Area the Indexing Method of Choice?

Increases in echocardiographic measurements predict outcome when indexed to various powers of height, BW, BMI, and BSA.

"A polymer network is a macroscopic assembly of long polymer molecules joined at several connection sites (crosslinks). The crosslinks can be either chemical or physical bonds. Gels may involve different types of interactions, such as hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interactions (e.g., ion bridges), hydrophobic interactions, etc.Gel slabs were kept immersed in solution throughout the duration of the AFM measurements. General purpose, oxide sharpened, silicon nitride tips of pyramidal shape were used for the AFM measurements, performed using a commercial AFM (Bioscope SZ with Nanoscope V controller, Veeco). The spring constants of the cantilevers were measured by the thermal tune method.The osmotic modulus is a measure of the contribution of osmotic pressure and elastic modulus to the compressive resistance of polymer gels. By relating K and G through concentration dependent scaling laws, we have demonstrated that K is significantly more sensitive to polymer concentration gradients than G.

"Chronic heroin use disrupts multiple physiological systems, contributing to addiction and relapse. Vulnerability to develop heroin addiction is due to drug induced and environmental factors, as well as genetic factors .

"The synthesis and release of renin are the key regulated steps of the renin angiotensin system cascade, which (through the generation of angiotensin II) regulates blood pressure and fluid/electrolyte homeostasis. Renin also plays a fundamental role in kidney development. Although renin was discovered over 100 years ago, only in the past few decades have the mechanisms for its synthesis and release begun to be thoroughly studied .Novel Mechanisms for the Control of Renin Synthesis and Release To further determine in vivo the role of the coactivators CBP and p300, which possess HAT activity, we generated mice with conditional deletion of CBP and p300 in the renin expressing cells. Individual deletion of CBP or p300 in renin expressing cells did not affect the expression of renin, and the morphology and function of the kidney were well preserved []. However, the simultaneous homozygous deletion of both CBP and p300 in renin expressing cells showed a striking decrease in the number of cells expressing renin concomitantly with marked structural renal abnormalities, including reduced kidney growth and extensive interstitial fibrosis [].In the past few years, major advances in the understanding of the mechanisms that control renin synthesis have been achieved largely through the availability of renin expressing tumoral cell lines, fluorescence marked renal arteriolar smooth muscle cells from the renin lineage, and transgenic mouse models, including a knock in of cre recombinase in the renin locus.

"Human skeletal muscle functional studies are notable for the variety of methodological approaches used. Functional evaluation of human muscle may range in scale from the highly invasive direct measurement of active, or passive muscle force to noninvasive or minimally invasive inference of function based on the electromyogram (EMG,) or a muscle image (Ultrasound, and MRI,). For the purposes of assigning cause effect relationships between muscle function and individual performance, it is desirable to obtain direct muscle function measurements in a clinically acceptable manner.Experiments performed in this report were similar to previously described methods but the anterior compartment of the leg remained intact. The tibialis anterior (TA) muscle of the New Zealand White rabbit (mass = 2.60.3 kg; n=9) was chosen for force and pressure measurements based on its accessibility, parallel fiber arrangement (pennation angle of 3 degrees), and predominantly fast fiber type percentage (95% fast fiber type,,). Control experiments demonstrated that the small transducer tip, representing only 0.2% of the muscle's physiological cross sectional area (PCSA) did not affect isometric force production after 40 isometric contractions.The raw intramuscular pressure time traces mimicked the general shape of the raw isometric force time traces but exhibited a drop in pressure over the course of activation as previously reported.

"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common and growing problem worldwide; in the United States, >10% of adults showing some evidence of kidney damage and/or reduced kidney function . Identification of CKD requires recognition of individual risk and appropriate laboratory testing (serum creatinine and/or urinary protein) , since symptoms generally do not manifest in earlier stages of CKD; however, earlier stage CKD can lead to several complications, such as anemia and bone mineral metabolism disorders, and poor outcomes, including cardiovascular events, morbidity, and mortality , in addition to progression to end stage renal disease (ESRD), requiring dialysis or transplant for survival. Despite these known adverse consequences of CKD, the majority of persons with the disease, especially prior to ESRD, remain unaware of their disease ().Provider level CKD awareness includes both general understanding of CKD, its risk factors, and associated complications/consequences and knowledge of patient management strategies to slow CKD progression.
